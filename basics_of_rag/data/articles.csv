1976-0,Jun-11-1976,"DANRNEOViIbLir, Wiig, (AP?
— Rep. Wayne Hays emerged
today from a coma induced by
an overdose of sleeping pills, his
doctor said. Hays smiled at his
wife and spoke short sentences
that made sense, the doctor
reported.

Dr. Richard Phillips said the
overdose taken by Hays, cen
tral figure in the congressional
payroll-sex scandal which
broke May 23, was apparently
accidental and that Hays should
be fully recovered within 10
days.

The 65-year-old Democratic
congressman was in satisfac-
tory condition, Phillips said, but
is still technically
semicomatose despite periods
when he makes rational
statements.

Hays was unconscious when
taken to the hospital Thursday
morning. He awakened at 5:30
a.m. this morning and asked to
see his wife, Pat, who kept a
night-long vigil at the hospital.
She returned to the room later
and the congressman smiled at
her, Phillips said.

‘His racovery should be com-
plete,”’ Phillips told a midmorn-
ing press briefing. After his
relaase from the hospital he will
have to rest for a week to 10


days before returning to his
congressional duties, the doctor
said.

In Washington, meanwhile,
House leaders said today that a
proposal to force Hays to resign
as chairman of the House Ad-
ministration Committee will be
put off until he recovers.

The proposal was scheduled
for action next Wednesday at a
meeting of the House
Democratic Caucus, but House
Speaker Car! Albert and House


Democratic leader Thomas P
O'Neill said there is no question
that meeting will be postponed.

Phillips said studies of the
blood are being made now at the
University of Pittsburgh to
determine the amount of the
sleeping-pill overdose. The pills
had been prescribed for Hays
because he was under stress,
Phillips said.

Also at the briefing was Carol
Clawson, Hays’s Washington

1976-1,Feb-20-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) —
Stunned by their failure to
override President Ford’s veto
of a $6.1 billion public works
jobs bill, congressional
Democrats are trying to figure
out what kind of substitute
measure they can offer.

There were plans in Congress
to seek a compromise jobs
measure, including talk of
giving quick consideration to
other pending job creating
legislation.

Two Republican sponsored
bills offered as alternatives to
the vetoed measure would
provide aid when the unem-
ployment rate nationwide
topped 7 per cent and the aid
would go to localities where the
rate was above 8 per cent. The
national rate in January was 7.8
per cent.

The cost of one bill was
estimated at $780 million in the
first year and would provide
funds for community
development in those areas of
high unemployment.

“This is really a_ bitter
disappointment,’’ said House


Majority Leader Thomas P.
O’Neill Jr., D-Mass., when told
the Senate had fallen three
votes short of overriding Ford’s
veto, 63 to 35.

A few hours earlier Thursday,
the House voted to override by
319 to 98, a margin of 41 votes.

Ford got the news on board
Air Force One, flying to a
campaign swing through New
Hampshire. He was described
as ‘elated’’ and claimed a
political victory over the
Democrats.

He called the jobs bill
“election-year politicking. It
= pork barreling of the worst

Democratic leaders were
shocked by the defeat of the
measure, which they had said
would generate up to 600,000

Robert Strauss, chairman of
the Democratic National
Committee, had termed the
struggle over the bill “a
political issue’’ during a
meeting with several big city

1976-2,Sep-19-1976,"WASHINGTON — AP — The
nation’s rate of economic growth
faltered from July through Sept-
tember, a slowdown reflected in the
increasing number of persons on the
jobless rolls during the summer, the
government reported today.

The Commerce Department said the
Gross National Product, the total
output of goods and services in the
economy, expanded at an annual rate
of 4 per cent in the third quarter.

The gross national product grew at
an annual rate of 4.5 per cent in the
second quarter and 9.2 per cent in the
first three month of the year.

Most economists consider the
growth rate during the second and
third quarters adequate only to
provide jobs for the expansion of the
nation’s labor force due to population
growth. They believe it is inadequate
to provide employment for persons
thrown out of work because of the
recession.

The Commerce report also showed
that inflation, as measured in the
Gross National Product, was less
severe in the third quarter. Prices rose
at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent,
compared to 5.2 per cent from May
through June.

The dollar value of the GNP in the
third quarter was placed at $1,709.7


DuwON.

The percentage increase was the
smallest since the 3.3 per cent growth
rate recorded in the fourth quarter of
1975.

The growth rate was held down in
part due to the slow build-up of
business inventories and a slower pace
of new investment in businesses and
homes.

Inventories: grew during the third
quarter at an annual rate of $14.4
billion, compared to an annual rate of
$16 billion in the previous three-month
period.

Total investment expanded at an
annual rate of 5 per cent during the
summer months, compared to 11.5 per
cent in the spring quarter, the
department said.

The GNP figures represent the
boradest measure of the nation’s
economic performance. Today’s
report is the last one due before the
November election.

The 4 per cent growth rate was in
line with economists’ predictions
during the past several weeks,
although it was well below ad-
ministration forecasts as recently as
July.

In midsummer, the administration
forecast the GNP growth rate would be

1976-3,Sep-10-1976,"BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) —A
British airliner and a Yugoslav
charter jet carrying West German
tourists collided at 35,000 feet near
Zagreb today, officials said. All 176
persons aboard the planes were
killed, according to doctors at the
scene.

A witness among the first to arrive
at the crash site said the body of one
plane was burned out. He said bodies
and luggage were scattered around
the rubble. More than 30 ambulances
and fire trucks went to the scene but
found no one alive, he said.

The British plane carried a
reported 54 passengers and nine crew
members. A_ British Airways
spokesman in New York said there
was one American and one Canadian
aboard the plane. However, British
Airways officials in London said there
were at least two Americans and
some Turkish nationals aboard.

The New York spokesman said it
would be 12 to 24 hours before a
passenger list was available.

The Yugoslav plane had 108
passengers and five crew members
aboard, company officials said.
Sources said most or all of them were
West German tourists returning from
vacations on the Adriatic coast.

The planes collided at 6:15 a.m.
EDT about 15 miles northeast of
Zagreb, Yugoslavia's second largest
city and 230 northwest of Belgrade.

The planes were in an established
air corridor over Yugoslavia utilized
by all civilian planes, officials said.
The corridor is under the control of
the Zagreb traffic center.

The cause of the collision was not
immediately known. Officials said an
investigation was begun.


British Airways officials in London
said Flight 476 was on a direct flight
from London to Istanbul. The officials
said the plane was a Trident 3 jetliner.

Reports here said the Yugoslavian
plane was a DC9 beloning to the
Yugoslav charter company Inex-
Adria. The DC9 was flying between
Split, Yugoslavia, and Cologne, West
Germany.

In Cologne, officials said the
Yugoslavian plane had been
chartered by Kaufhof, a Cologne-
based tourist agency.


The crash was the worst collision
since July 1971, when an All-Nippon
Airways Boeing 727 collided with a
Japanese air force F86 over Morioka,
Japan, killing 84 persons aboard the
planes and 71 on the ground.

The most recent American air colli-
sion occurred in September 1969.
EFighty-three persons died when an
Allegheny Airlines DC9 hit a student
pilot’s plane at Shelbyville, Ind.

A spate of near-misses last year
prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration to order the installa-


tion of more modern air traffic con-
trol equipment and revise procedures
for controllers.

The incidents also led the FAA to
hasten plans for installing a com-
puterized conflict alert system, which
would issue warnings when aircraft
within a four-to five-miles sphere
came too close.

An FAA spokesman here said the
new system was in effect at all of the
agency’s 20 in-route traffic control
centers in the United States by
January of this year.

1976-4,Dec-15-1976,"DOHA, Qatar (AP) — The
Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC)
opened a price-fixing meeting
today with only conservative
Saudi Arabia, the cartel’s
biggest producer, opposed to an
Hherease in the price of crude
oil.

The Saudi oil minister, Sheik
Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said on
his arrival in Doha that his
country favors postponing the
increase for six more months
because the world economy is
still too shaky. The Saudis
previously , said they would
agree to a ‘reasonable
increase’ of less than 10 per
eent in the price of $11.51 for a
barre] of benchmark crude.

The ministers of the 13 nations
who supply 80 per cent of the oil


‘imported by the world’s non-
Communist nations met behind
bulletpraof ‘shutters in the
banquet hall of a luxurious hotel
beside the Persian Gulf.

Indonesian Oi Minister
Mohammed Sadli, the current
chairman of OPEC, opened the
conference with a reminder to
the ministers that their
decisions would “affect the
state of health of the world, not
only now but for some time to
come.”

we nope to convince the
members of OPEC of our
views,"" Yamani said. ‘We
believe we have a strong view,
but we never come with a
position we can't change.”

Yamani said his government
has found that the trend of
international economic


recovery ‘‘is not as strong as we
hoped to have.” He noted that
Saudi Arabian light crude is the
benchmark oil on which OPEC's
price structure is based, and he
commented: “I don't think
OPEC will be ta pester to raise
the price of Saudi crude without
the consent of Saudi Arabia.""'

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading
moderate as well as its largest
producer, is under heavy
pressure from the United States
to hold the oil price line.

President-elect Carter told a
news conference Tuesday that
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and his successor,
Cyrus R. Vance, both talked
with representatives of the oil
nations, and Carter said he felt
“very good about their
attitude |


The U.S. State Department
said this week that each 5 per
cent increase in the price of
crude oil would mean a rise of .B
cent a gallon in the price of
gasoline in the United States,

Most of the 12-:member OPEC
group have been insisting on a
price boost despite the
contention of the industrialized
nations that it would worsen
inflation, hamper recovery
from the worldwide economic
slowdown and work more
hardship on the underdeveloped
nations than on the
industrialized countries.

The price ‘‘hawks’' argue that
the cost of goods they import
from the industrial nations has
risen as much as 25 per cent
since OPEC's last oil price rise
in October 1975.

1976-5,Feb-13-1976,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ac-
tor Sal Mineo, known as “The
Switchblade Kid"" for his many
film roles as a teen-age tough,
has been stabbed to death out-
side his Hollywood apartment
house, authorities said.

Witnesses told police they
heard screams and saw a man
with long, blond hair running
from the alley where Mineo
was killed Thursday night.

Sheriff's Information Officer
Anthony Silas said investigators
were still searching for the
murder weapon. He said there
was no immediate indication of
the motive for the attack.

Neighbors found the 37-year-


old actor lying face-up in a pool
of blood about 20 feet from a
parking area behind his apart-
ment, police said. He had been
stabbed in the chest.

Bill Jones, a neighbor in the
moderately expensive apart-
ments near the Sunset Strip,
said, “We heard about three
yells. The last yell was ‘Help.’
We rushed out and saw Sal ly-
ing face-up, breathing really
hard.

“He was like in a daze, try-
ing to breathe. He didn’t say
anything.”

Another neighbor, Mary
Chance, 21, said, “It was too
quiet. Then all of a sudden
those screams, we heard those
screams.”

Neighbors said Mineo was
quiet and kept to himseif.

Authorities said the actor ap-
parently lived alone and that
his family resides in New York.

Mineo was in rehearsal for a
starring role in ‘‘P.S. Your Cat


Is Dead,” a play scheduled to
open next week at the West-
wood Playhouse.

Recent television appear-
ances by the baby-faced actor
included roles in the Ellery
Queen and Joe Forrester
shows.


Highlights of his acting ca-
reer included his portrayal of a
juvenile delinquent along with
James Dean in ‘Rebel Without
A Cause” and later as an Is-
raeli terrorist in “Exodus.”

1976-6,Mar-03-1976,"BOSTON (AP) — Sen. Henry
M. Jackson said mistrust of de-
tente and support from “blue
and white collar workers’’
brought him victory in the Mas-
sachusetts Democratic pri-
mary.

Jackson indicated he would
turn his attention to Florida
now, but said that primary next
Tuesday will not be decisive in
gaining the nomination.

Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona
ran second in the Massachu-
setts vote Tuesday and was
clearly the leader arnong the
party's liberal candidates. Sen.
Birch Bayh, another liberal,
was seventh among the eight
Democrats and his aides said
he would probably announce his
plans Thursday. There had
been speculation Bayh would
drop out of the race, based on
his own statement that if he
didn’t do well in the early pri-
maries he might drop out.

But the spokesman said, “ ..
at this point I’m relucant to
speculate on whe ¢ we go from
here.”

Sen. Fred * .rris, who also
fared poorly here, said he
would stay in the race and wage
strong campaigns in New York
and Illinois.

Jackson told a news confer-
ence today, ‘I won it on the is-
sues,” such as distrust of de-
tente with Russia and support
of a 200-mile offshore fishing
limit.

Referring repeatedly to “the
working people’’ as the source
of his strength, the Washington
senator said he left it up to oth-
ers to bring up the busing issue.
— made a busing speech.

nded to questions.
‘ll fight the bigots wherever
te Bi Let’s get an honest dialog


going on the alternatives to
busing,’’ he said.

School busing has stirred
controversy in Boston for
months.

Beaming broadly, Jackson
said many had warned him he
was too conservative to win in
Massachusetts, the only state to
vote for George McGovern in
1972, but, ‘‘we proved this was
untrue.”

In Florida, Jackson will face
his most serious challenge from
Southerners George C. Wallace
and Jimmy Carter. Wallace ran
third in Massachusetts and
Carter fourth.

President Ford, meanwhile,
said he was pleased with his
victory over former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan in Mas-
sachusetts, where Reagan's
name was on the ballot, and in
Vermont, where it wasn't. Ver-
mont’s primary was also held
Tuesday.


With final unofficial returns
from Massachusetts counted,
Ford had 114,042 votes, or 62 per
cent, and 27 delegates, to
Reagan's 62,951 votes, or 35 per
cent, and 15 delegates.

Lyn Noziger, Reagan’s press
aide, said Reagan issued the
following statement:

‘IT am most pleased with the
results of the primary election
in both Massachusetts and Ver-
mont ... These results, along
with last week’s results in New
Hampshire, show clearly that
there’s a great dissatisfaction
within the Republican party
with the leadership our nation
is being given.”

In Vermont final unofficial
returns gave Ford 26,564 votes,
or 84 per cent, to Reagan's 4,-
983 write-in votes or 16 per cent.

Carter got nearly half the
Democratic vote Tuesday in
Vermont. He conceded, how-
ever, he was ‘‘overly optimis-
tic’’ in predicting a finish in the
top three in Massachusetts
after winning New Hamp-
shire’s primary a week ago.
did not campaign as ex-
tensively in Massachusetts as
the others.

All the other Democrats cam-
paigned extensively in the Bay
State. Jackson and Wallace
didn’t run in New Hampshire so
they could concentrate their
efforts here. It is estimated that
more than $1 million was spent
by all the candidates.

An informed observer said
Jackson probably spent the
most, an estimated $400,000.

Based on final unofficial re-
turns the lineup in Massachu-
setts was:

—Jackson 162,567 votes, or 23

1976-7,May-07-1976,"VENICE, Italy (AP) — Rescue
workers dug frantically today for pos-
sible survivors in the earthquake
ruins of dozens of towns and villages
in northeast Italy and it was feared
the death toll would reach at least
300

Art treasures apparently escaped
damage, however, in the massive
shock Thursday night that was felt in
half of Italy and at least six other
countries, causing panic among mil-
lions. There were no reports of casu-
alties or major damage outside Italy
or in major Italian cities.

At midday today, national police
headquarters in Rome reported 243
bodies recovered in 19 towns, with
scores feared trapped under the


wreckage of leveled buildings. More
than 1,000 persons were injured, a
number of them seriously.

A US. Army base in Vicenza sent
out six helicopters to shuttle the in-
jured to hospitals and to ferry medi-
cine and water.

The worst quake in the last 10
years in Europe and Asia Minor was
in eastern Turkey in 1966 when 2.529
were killed. More than 17,000 died in
Guatemala in a quake last February

Thursday night's quake rocked an
area from Venice to the Yugoslav
border in the east to Milan in the
west and tremors were felt as far
south as Naples, as well as in sec-
tions of Yugoslavia, Austria, Czech-
oslovakia, West Germany, The Neth-


erlands and Belgium. Hundreds of
Belgians fled from high-rise apart-
ment houses.

Floods in November 1966 heavily
damaged Florence's art patrimony
and accelerated the decay of
churches and other buildings in Ve-
nice.

But after an intensive check of
buildings in the lagoon city today by
the Venice fire department, a city of-
ficial reported that not one church or
historic monument “suffered the
least bit of damage ”

The 325-foot bell-tower in St
Mark's Square swayed during the
shocks, but a careful inspection by
the specially trained fire squad
showed no damage


The tower. built originally in 889

ing in 1902. to be rebuilt again in
1912.

The most important of the hun-
dreds of churches and monuments in
Venice have had small mirrors im-
bedded on the end of long pipes in
their walls and foundations by shin-
ing lights down the pipes, it was
found today that not a single mirror
had broken, indicating there had been
no shifting in the structures.

1976-8,Apr-28-1976,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jimmy Carter swept to
victory in the Pennsylvania presidential primary elec-
tion Tuesday night, stepping the Democrats who had
tried to stop him, and gaining new momentum in his
frontrunning campaign for White House nomination

The former Georgia governor told cheering supporters
the triumph means “We're going to win, win on the first
ballot”

Carter was gaining 35 per cent of the popular vote in
Pennsylvania’s presidential preference election
Returns were tallied slowly in the separate competition
for delegates

The early delegate count showed Carter supporters
leading in that phase of the primary, too But the figures
were inconclusive, and the outcome will not be clear for
days.

While Carter said he had swept aside every possinle
obstacle in his path, there remained the looming figure of
Sen. Hubert H Humphrey, who skipped the primaries.

Humphrey, in Washington, said “{ want to see the


Democratic party win Uf Jummy Carter can win, l’m not
going to try to stop him at all”

Carter beat Sen Henry M. Jackson of Washington,
with Rep Morris K Udall of Arizona running third The
Georgian won over the opposition of orgamzed labor and
a lineup of Democratic leaders, who put together a stop-
Carter movement in an acknowledged effort to slow him
and keep the race open for a late Humphrey entry.

That hasn’t been foreclosed But Carter will be more
difficult to head off now. He has won seven of the first
nine primaries, and he is the only candidate entered in all
the rest.

President Ford, unopposed on the Republican ballot in
Pennsylvama, said in Longview, Tex., he thought a
Pennsylvania victory would make Carter the
Democratic nominee “If Carter wins in Pennsylvania, |
don’t see how the Democratic smoke-filled roonis in New
York can take the nomination away from him,"" Ford

1976-9,Feb-06-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP)
The nation’s unemployment
rate dropped from 8.3 per
cent to 7.8 per cent in
January, the largest monthly
decline in the jobless rate in
more than 16 years, the
government said today.

The Labor Department said
total employment in January
increased by 800,000, the larg-
est monthly job increase
since early 1960. Total em-
ployment in the economy in
January was 86.2 million,
which was close to the
prerecession peak employ-
ment in July of 1974.

The Labor Department fig-
ures are sure to win the Ford
administration support for its
economic policies in 1976.

The gains in employment
were widespread throughout
the economy, with only the
teen-age jobless rate failing
to improve.

The Labor Department
gave the following unem-
ployment breakdown:

~Adult men, 5.8 per cent,
down from 6.6 per cent in De-
cember.


~Adult women, 7.5 per
cent, down from 8 per cent.

~ Whites, 7.1 per cent, down
from 7.6 per cent.

Blacks and other races,
13.2 per cent, down from 13.8
per cent.

~-Heads of households, 5.1
per cent, down from 5.7 per
cent.

~Married men, 4.1 per
cent, down from 4.8 per cent.

~—Full-time workers, 7.3 per
cent, down from 7.9 per cent.

~-White collar workers, 4.7
per cent, down from 4.8 per
cent.

~Blue collar workers, 9.4
per cent, down from 10.7 per
cent.

~~Teen-agers, 19.9 per cent,
up from 19.6 per cent in De-
cember.

The Labor Department said
total employment in January
was 2.1 million above the
- recession low of last March,
when the unemployment rate
was 8.5 per cent. The peak
unemployment rate during
the recession was 8.9 per cent
in May, when the labor force
had shrunk to a low level.

1976-10,Mar-19-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A near-record
drop in grocery prices held inflation to
its smallest monthly increase in more
than four years during February as
consumer prices rose only one-tenth of a
per cent, the government said today.

Falling prices for beef led the decline
at grocery counters where prices
tumbled 1.5 per cent, the biggest
monthly drop in 24 years, the Labor
Department said.

Gasoline prices also declined, but the
department said the food was the big
factor in the slowdown of prices last
month.

February's increase in overall
consumer prices compared with an
increase of four-tenths of a per cent in
January and was the smallest since
September, 1971, when prices also rose
one-tenth of a per cent. All figures are
adjusted to account for seasonal
influences.


Nonfood prices also continued to
increase at a moderate rate last month,
while the cost of services such as
medical fees and auto insurance went up
sharply but at a somewhat slower rate
than in January.

The department said the consumer
price index in February stood at 167.1
meaning that consumers had to pay
$167.10 for goods and services that cost
$100 in the 1967 base period. The index is
not seasonally adjusted.

Despite the small February increase
in prices, consumer prices still were 6.3
per cent higher than a year ago. How-
ever, that is the lowest 12-month
increase since July 1973, when prices
had risen 5.7 per cent.

Wholesale prices, which foreshadow
trends at the retail level, have fallen at
an adjusted annual rate of 3.8 per cent
since November.


The Labor Department also said that
spendable earnings of workers showed
no change in February after rising two-
tenths of a per cent in January. Over the
year, real earnings — what's left after
taxes and inflation — were up 4.8 per

cent.

The Labor Department said the 1.5 per
cent drop in grocery prices, which
accounts for the major portion of the
food index, was the second biggest drop
since the Labor Department began
tracking these prices in 1952.

The latest price report follows a spate
of economic reports this week showing
steady improvement in almost all sec-
tors of the economy.

Industrial production in February
increased for the 10th consecutive
month, housing starts jumped 27 per
cent to the highest level in nearly two
years and businesses began expanding
inventories by the biggest margin in
over a year, the government reported.


Ford administration officials consider
the economic news since the first of the
year a vindication of their policies and a
boost for the President's election
chances.

Unemployment also has dropped
dramatically over the past four months,
and wholesale prices have declined at an
adjusted annual rate of 3.8 per cent since
November.

Treasury Secretary William E. Simon
predicted earlier this week, in the
administration's most optimistic
forecast to date, that joblessness may
drop below 7 per cent this year and that
inflation will decline to about 2 per cent
within three years.

But the Congressional Budget Office
warned that while the recovery is
progressing, the improvement rate
could slow sharply next year unless the

1976-11,Mar-06-1976,"WASHINGTON (UPI) —
Wholesale prices fell 0.5 per cent in
February, the biggest monthly
decline in nearly a year, the Labor
Department said today.

The overall decline reflected the
fourth consecutive monthly drop in
food prices and an easing of
inflationary pressures on industrial
goods.

Wholesale prices, which “gen-
erally foreshadow prices paid by
consumers, have either declined or
remained unchanged over the past
four months. But February's report
showed the biggest single monthly
improvement since an 0.5 per cent
drop in March, 1975.

Following a 1.8 per cent leap last
October, whoiesale prices remained
unchanged in November, declined
0.4 per cent in December and were
unchanged again in January.

The Feburary wholesale price
report brought good news for
President Ford. who has cited
recent improvements in inflation
unemployment as evidence his go-
slow economic policies are working.
February's unemployment report
was to be released Friday.

Wholesale prices for industrial
goods rose 0.3 per cent, compared to
average monthly increases of 0.7
per cent during the last half of 1975.
Contributing to this improvement
was a substantial decline in fuel and
power costs caused in large
measure by reduced crude
petroleum prices under the Energy
Policy and Conservation Act.

Food and farm prices fell 2.3 per
cent, continuing a trend that began
last November. Meat and dairy
prices declined along with sugar
prices -- which had increased
during January.

The Wholesale Price Index in
February was 179.4, or 4.7 per cent
higher than a year ago. This means
that goods costing $100 in 1967 now
cost $179.40.

Ford's critics, particularly those
in organized labor and on the
campaign trail, have contended that
the economic indicators will sour in
coming months.

Behind February's higher
industrial prices were increases for
lumber and wood prices, leather
goods, rubber and plastic products,
scrap metals and foundry and forge
shop products, some textiles,
machinery and some chemicals.

Fuel and power costs declined
primarily because lower prices tor
crude petroleum, residual fuels,
gasoline and bituminous coal more
than offset increases for coke,
liquefied petroleum gas, distillate .
oils and electric power.

1976-12,Apr-02-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s
unemployment rate edged down to 7.5
per cent of the work force in March,
marking the fifth straight monthly
decline and the longest sustained drop in
14 years, the government said today.

Although the decline was slight —
down from 7.6 per cent in February —
Labor Department analysts said the
steady improvement since October re-
flected continuing economic recovery
from the recession.

Total employment continued climbing
in March, rising by another 375,000 to an


all-time high of 86.7 million, the govern-
ment said. Since reaching a recession-
low last March, the number of
Americans with jobs has risen by 2.6
million, with adult women accounting
for more than half of the inncrease.

The last time the unemployment rate
dropped five consecutive months was
between September 1961 and February
1962.

Unemployment declined gradually
from the recession peak of 8.9 per cent
last May and hovered about 8.6 per cent
before beginning a rapid decline last


October. But even with the improvement
the jobless rate at 7.5 per cent remains
far above its normal post World War II
level.

Nevertheless, the Ford administration
cited the improvement in the jobless
rate and the declining inflation rate as
vindication of its cautious economic
policy. It also has been a boost to
President Ford's election campaign.

Government economists see further
improvement in the jobless rate this
year, but caution that the decline is not
likely to be continuous every month. In
advance of the new unemployment
report, Julius Shiskin, commissioner of
labor statistics, had said he wouldn't be
surprised to see the jobless rate edge up
in March.

Shiskin said the normal decline in
unemployment during the first year
after a recession is about 1.5 per cent. By
February, it had already fallen by more
than 1 per cent, and he predicted a drop
of another one-half to three-quarers of a
point during the rest of the year.

Jobless rates among most of the


worker groups in the labor force were
relatively unchanged last month with
the exception of blacks whose
unemployment rate fell 1.2 per cent to
12.5 per cent. Much of the improvement
was among adult women, the
government said.

Joblessness among blacks is now down
nearly 2 percentage points from last
September's peak of 14.4 per cent.

The average length of unemployment
fell for the second straight month to 15.8
weeks in March, about a week lower
than at the peak of the recession last
year.

Another bright note was the decline in
the number of discouraged workers
during the first three months of the year.
Discouraged workers are those who
want to work but have given up looking
for jobs because they believe none are
available.

Their numbers, which nearly doubled
between the third quarters of 1974 and
1975 to a high of nearly 1.2 million,
receded to 940,000 during the first
quarter in 1976.

1976-13,Mar-21-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Falling prices
at the gasoline pump and the third big
monthly drop in grocery costs held the rise
in consumer prices to two-tenths of a per
cent in March, the government said today.

The March increase compared with
February's consumer price rise of one-
tenth of a per cent and an increase of four-
tenths of a per cent in January. The
January-to-March figures left consumers
with the lowest three-month inflation rate
in almost four years.

The Labor Department said the increase
for the three months ending in March — a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.9 per


cent — was the smallest three-month
increase since June 1972. It compared with
an average increase of about 7 per cent for
each calendar quarter in 1975.

Lower beef prices led the decline at
grocery counters where prices fell another
1.2 per cent in March. Grocery prices fell
1.5 per cent in February after a decline of
four-tenths of a per cent in January.

Gasoline prices fell 1.3 per cent instead
of moving up as they usually do in March.

The cut in the nation's inflation rate has
exceeded even the most optimistic
projections, but the Ford administration
had cautioned that the declines in food and
fuel are not likely to be sustained.

Maynard Comiez, acting chief
economist for the Commerce Department,
said in an interview before the price report
was issued that food and gasoline prices
were beginning to climb higher.

“I don’t expect to see a sharp reac-
celeration in prices, but I do think we
might see some increases larger than we
have been getting,”’ he said.

Despite the slowing of inflation, the
purchasing power of the average
American worker fell seven-tenths of a per


cent in March because weekly earnings
were held back by a reduction in working
hours. However, over the year purchasing
power was up 4.3 per cent.

The Consumer Price Index stood at 167.5
in March, meaning that it cost consumers
$167.50 to buy the same variety of goods
and services purchased for $100 in 1967.
Over the past year, prices have risen 6.1
per cent, the smallest gain in any Meow

since the year ending July, 1973,

The Agriculture Department reported
earlier this month that consumer food
prices on the average held steady early
this year, but cautioned shoppers to expect
increases in the coming months, although
at a slower rate than in recent years.

Although Agriculture Department of-
ficals so far have declined to predict food
prices beyond mid-year, previous
estimates indicated that consumers might
see food costs go up an average of 5 to 6 per
cent over the entire 12 months, compared
with a gain of 8.5 per cent in 1975.

The leveling off of food prices was
largely due to sharp declines in meat
prices, which officials say have already
started climbing.

1976-14,Oct-21-1976,"WASHINGTON (UPI) — The cost of
living, a key barometer of the nation’s
inflation rate, rose 0.4 per cent in
September, the smallest advance since
April, the Labor Department reported
today.

The main reason for the slowdown,
the report said, was a leveling of food
prices.

Last month’s rise in the Consumer
Price Index, which translates into an
annual rate of 4.8 per cent, was smaller
than the 0.6 per cent increase in May
and the 0.5 per cent jump in June
through August. The CPI rose an
identical 0.4 per cent in April.

Today’s report is welcome news for


President Ford, whose presidential
campaign effort has been hit hard in
recent weeks with a series of disap-
pointing economic reports.

The September consumer price
figure—the last to be published before
the election— indicates that despite
sluggish growth in the economy, in-
flation slowed somewhat last month.

Ford's economic advisers have
maintained throughout this year's
campaign that the economy must be
brought along slowly so as not to
rekindle the disastrous inflation of the
recession.

Following three months of relatively
small] increases, food prices showed no
change between August and Sep-


tember. This leveling in the cost of food
accounted in large part for the
slowdown in the overall inflation rate.

Prices for commodities other than
food—such as autos, clothing, gasoline.
etc.—rose by 0.4 per cent in September,
an improvement over the 0.6 per cent
rate recorded in both July and August..

The rise in the cost of services also
slowed last month, rising 0.5 per cent
after three consecutive months of 0.6
per cent increases.

For the third quarter as a whole,
inflation grew at an annual rate of 5.8
per cent, compared with 6.1 per cent in
the spring quarter. In the first three
months of this year, prices rose by 2.9
per cent.

1976-15,Feb-21-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The first
decline in retail food prices in five
months contributed to a further
slowdown in the nation’s inflation rate
in January, the government reported
Friday.

There also were lower prices during
the month for gasoline, heating fuels
and new cars, while prices rose for

postage, auto insurance and medical
care.

The Labor Department said over-all
consumer prices in January rose
four-tenths of one per cent on a
seasonally adjusted basis, down from a
five-tenths increase in December.

Meanwhile, the New York Stock
Exchange closed Friday at its highest
level in more than three years, passing
the 40 million-share mark for the first
time in the exchange’s history in the
process.

The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials climbed 12.04 to 987.80, its
highest close since it finished at 996.76
on Feb. 13, 1973.

The NYSE volume totaled 44.5]
million shares, besting the old mark of
39.21 million set Thursday.

Analysts attributed the
record setting day to signs of
improving business conditions and the
Stabilizing of interest rates and
inflation.

Investors evidently read the dividend
increase announced by American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. on
Wednesday as an expression of strong
optimism over the business outlook by
the nation’s most widely held
corporation.


The January price rise was well
within the Ford administration's
inflation target for 1976 of just under 6
per cent, and President Ford said it
shows his policies are working.

“‘What we've done is really get a
handle on one of the most insidious,
adverse economic factors,” he said
during a campaign appearance at
Dover, N.H.

The Labor Department also had good
news for wage earners, reporting that
real spendable earnings of workers in-
creased two-tenths of one per cent
during January and 4.3 per cent for the
12-month period.

The growth in workers’ spendable
earnings — which are earnings after
the effects of taxes and inflation are
subtracted — has been a major factor
in the nation’s steady recovery from
recession. :

Economic statistics undoubtedly will
play a key role in the presidential
campaign, with Ford and his advisers
trying to get as much mileage as pos-
sible out of favorable reports, while
opponents will use unfavorable
Statistics to attack the President.

Progress against inflation was clear
in the 12-month figures, which showed
consumer prices were up 6.8 per cent in
January over a year earlier. That was
the lowest 12-month increase since July
1973, when prices had risen by 5.7 per
cent.

The Labor Department said its
Consumer Price Index for January
stood at 166.7 per cent of the 1967
average, meaning that goods that cost
$100 in 1967 were selling for $166.70 last

1976-16,Jun-04-1976,"WASHINGTON (UPI) —
Unemployment among Ameri-
can workers declined slightly to
7.3 per cent in May and the
number of persons holding jobs
reached a record 87.7 million,
the Labor Department reported
today.

It was the eighth consecutive
month without an increase in
the jobless rate, the Labor
Department said. Not since
1973, just prior to the recession,
has unemployment shown no
increase over an eight-month
period.

The number of persons who
work hit a record peak for the
fourth straight month, climbing
by 300,000 to 87.7 million in
May. Women benefited most by
the improvement.

Joblessness was down from
7.5 per cent, in April and
showed a significant reduction
from the recession peak of 8.9
per cent set last May. There
has been no increase in
unemployment since last Sep-
tember.

The number of employed
persons has increased by 3.6
million since the recession low,


but joblessness has shown
substantially less improvement.
There are now 1.4 million fewer
unemployed persons than the
recession peak last May.

Strikes had a heavy impact
on May’s employment picture.
A 45-day-old walkout by 60,000
rubber workers caused a slight
decline in manufacturing em-
ployment. Nonfarm _ payroll
employment would have risen
by about 150,000 had it not been
for strikes.

Unemployment fell by about
180,000 to 6.9 million in May, a
reduction that occurred almost
entirely among women. In-
creased employment for women
was explained primarily by an
expansion of jobs in the service
industries and govenment —
the traditionally female jobs.

Joblessness among women
dropped from 7.3 per cent to 6.8
per cent, reflecting a continuing
improvement among female
household heads. Unemploy-
ment meanwhile rose slightly
among men.

Teen-age unemployment
dropped to 18.5 per cent and
joblessness among blacks fell to
12.2 per cent.

1976-17,Mar-19-1976,"WASHINGTON (UPI) — Con-
sumer prices increased at the
lowest rate in tour years during
february as food costs took their
sharpest drop since 1956, the Labor
Department reported Friday.

The 0.1 per cent rise in the
Consumer Price Index compared to
0.4 per cent in January and a 0.6 per
cent average for the last quarter of
last year.

This put the index at 167.1, before
seasona! adjustment, meaning that
goods Costing $100 in the 1967 base
oe went for $167.10 in February.

The February increase was the
smalijest since September, 1971, the
department said, and the 1.0 per
cent drop in overall food prices was
the biggest downturn since 1956.


Foods sold in grocery stores
declined in price by 1.5 per cent,
compared to a 0.4 per cent drop the
previous month.

The February figures bore out
predictions by administration
economists that inflation would
continue easing during the early
months of this year, reflecting lower
food costs and gradual effects ot a
sharp drop in overall wholesale
prices over the last four months.

President Ford's press secretary,
tion Nessen, called the report by the
Labor Deparimeni’s Bureau of
Labor Statists ‘excellent nows’’ and
‘further evidence that the
President's economic policy is

working.
But he said, “At the same time |


think we all feel a sense of caution.
it will be difficult to have such a
small increase each month.”

The February figures showed that


gasoline prices declined while
charges tor consumer services rose,
although at a slower rate than in
January.

1976-18,Nov-29-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme
Court said Monday it will decide whether
former President Richard M. Nixon should
control records of his administration,
including 888 reels of White House tape
recordings.

The court agreed to hear arguments by
Nixon's attorneys that Congress violated
the exPresident’s rights to privacy and
invaded the powers of the presidency two
years ago when it gave control of the
massive records to the General Services
Administration.

A three-judge federal court in
Washington upheld the Presidential
Materials and Recordings Preservation
Act, discounting arguments by Nixon's
lawyers. If the Justices agree with the
lower court, an estimated 42 million pages
of documents, including about 200,000
prepared or reviewed by Nixon, and the
tapes will remain with the GSA.

If the Supreme Court rules in favor of
Nixon, the material would be shipped to
San Clemente, Calif., the ex-President’s
home since his resignation Aug. 9, 1974.

The court will hear arguments in the
case next year.

After the Watergate scandals forced his
resignation, Nixon asked the government
to ship the documents and tapes to San
Clemente. The GSA agreed to let Nixon
retain title to the presidential materials in
a pact that required Nixon to donate a
substantial portion of them to the govern-
ment at a later date.

That agreement was shietentoatt,
however, when Watergate special
prosecutor Leon Jaworski requested a
delay in handing over the documents to
Nixon.

The former President sued, and
Congress then passed the legislation.

The act calls for the GSA to govern
public access to the material. The Senate
has rejected one set of proposed
regulations for such governing,and
another proposal is pending.

The material is available to Nixon but
such access is subject to GSA regulation.

In their appeal to the high court, Nixon’s


attorneys said the materials reflect the
former President's ‘entire personal,
political and official life.’ They said he
“never intended the records ... or his diary
to be reviewed by anyone other than
himself or his family.”

Nixon said the materials covered by the
1974 act include notes and letters from
friends and family members as well as
taped conversations with his wife,
daughters, physician, attorneys and
friends.

The Justice Department and several
groups who filed friend of the court briefs
opposing Nixon's bid for control said the
presidential records are government
property, even if Nixon mixed personal
records with those of the office he held.

Among the tapes are the 30 segments
played during the Watergate cover-up trial
of Nixon's top advisers.

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington last month, ruled that those
tapes now can be released to the public.

Transcripts of the tapes were made
available at the time of the trial. Release
of the tapes, however, would let the public
know what expletives were deleted from
transcripts and also give the tone and
inflections of voice used by Nixon,
Watergate figures John D. Ehrlichman, H.
R. Haldeman, John N. Mitchell, John W.
Dean and others.

1976-19,Mar-16-1976,"LONDON (AP) — In a_ surprise
announcement that stunned Parliament and
rocked the stock exchange, Prime Minister
Harold Wilson said today he will resign as soon
as Laborites in the House of Commons pick a
new leader. Wilson, who turned 60 last
Thursday, cited age as the reason.

A special meeting of Labor lawmakers was


she takes over. Wilson’s five year-term
have expired in October 1979.

Lawmakers at Parliament poured out of
committee rooms into the corridors when news
of Wilson's announcement reached them. The
prime minister had given no public hint that he
was about to resign, and many members of
Parliament at first refused to believe the an-
nouncement.

On the stock exchange following Wilson's
announcement, people were ‘dashing around
all over the place,” one dealer said. “It was
chaos and confusion for 10 minutes.”” The pound
opened at $1.920 and went down to $1.9160 after
Wilson’s announcement. The Bank of England
intervened and the rate then improved slightly
to $1.9170.

Wilson's government suffered a stinging 28-
vote defeat in the House of Commons last
Wednesday on its plans to slash public spending
by $6 billion. The defeat was caused by a revolt
of 37 left-wing Laborites. The same day, the
opposition Conservative party won two special
parliamentary elections with increased
majorities, cutting into Labor's slice of the
vote. On Thursday, however, the government
survived a vote of confidence in Parliament by
a majority of 17. _ .

Wilson's government under sharp
attack from the Conservative opposition led by
50-year-old Margaret Thatcher as well as the
left-wing Laborites. Over the past 12 months,
Britain's annual rate of inflation has hovered
around 25 per cent, the highest in the
industrialized world, and the pound sterling

below the psychologically important
$2 floor for the first time in history March 5.

Wilson’s official announcement said he told
the cabinet of his decision this morning and
then went to Buckingham Palace and informed
Queen Elizabeth II.

Wilson pointed out in his statement that he
had been Labor party leader for more than 13
“exciting and turbulent years — nearly eight of
them in government.

1976-20,Jan-25-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) -
Although unemployment
remains ~ high, almost
everything else in the
economy is starting to look
good and Americans may be
entitled to another major tax
cut in 1979, President Ford
said today.

“The underlying fact about
our economy is that it is
steadily growing healthier.
My policies for 1976 are in-


tended to keep us on that
upward path,”’ Ford said in his
annual economic report to
Congress. He also
said,‘‘Regrettably, a full
recovery of the economy will
take time.”’

Despite the prospect of job
gains this year, Ford’s
economic advisers. said
“unemployment will almost
surely remain distressingly

high. . .


“Even under the best of
circumstances the return to
full employment cannot
realistically be accomplished
this year or next.”’

Ford did not indicate how
much taxes could be
decreased in 1979, but he said
the decrease would be on top
of the $28 billion in permanent
tax decreases he already has
proposed for this year and
next.


He also tied the prospect of
future tax reductions to
support for his spending
recommendations, including
the $394.2-billion budget he is
proposing for fiscal 1977.

‘If we continue in the years
ahead to pursue the kind of
budgetary restraint which I
am recommending, another
major tax cut will be feasible
by 1979,” he said.

Ford’s economic report,

which Congress receives
annually from the President
and his Council of Economic
Advisers, stressed that the
worst is over for the economy.
It said Americans can take
satisfaction that the nation’s
economic system has come
through intact.
_ There have been ‘‘ap-
'preciable gains’ in reducing
inflation, which declined from
12 per cent in 1974 to 7 per cent
in 1975, with an additional
slow-down expected this year,
Ford said.

‘While I do not regard the
events of 1975 as_ fully
satisfactory by any measure,
we should find it reassuring
that our economic system
withstood severe strains and
displayed inherent strengths
during the year,”’ he said.

Unemployment remains a
serious problem, Ford said,
but ‘‘it is slowly moving in the
right direction.’’ Any attempt
to bring the jobless rate down
quickly could ignite new in-
flation and make matters
worse in the long run, he said.

Ford’s economic report
gave the following outlook for
this year:

-Unemployment will decline
to about 7.3 per cent by the end
of the year, down from 8.3 per
cent in December 1975. That
means nearly 6.6 million
jobseekers still will be unable
to find work.

-Inflation will decline to
about 6 per cent during the
year, compared with 7 per
cent last year.

-The economy will grow
between 6 and 6.5 per cent, as
measured by the nation’s
Gross National Product. The
GNP declined 2 per cent in
1975 and 1.8 per cent in 1974.

The report said Americans
will have about 5 per cent
more money to spend this
year, even after inflation is
taken into account. Con-
sumption purchases should
increase about 6 per cent,
because Americans are ex-
pected to save slightly less
this year than in 1975.

Also in the 1976 economic
outlook is an increase in
business investment of 4 to 5
per cent, a rise in housing
starts to a rate of about 1.75
million units by the end of the
year, new gains for auto sales
and a jump of 25 per cent in
business operating profits.

1976-21,Jan-27-1976,"By Rein Pasha

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The country is
gradually recovering from the worst
recession since World War II but inflation
will remain at about 6 per cent through
1976 and unemployment will remain
“distressingly high’ despite some im-
provement, President Ford's chief
economists said today.

“Even under the best of circumstances,
the return to full employment cannot
realistically be accomplished this year or
next,’ Ford’s Council of Economic
Advisers said in its annual report.

But food and energy price increases
should be moderate, housing construction
should increase significantly, consumer
spending should rise and the nation’s total
“real” output of goods and services
should climb into plus figures after two
years of declines, it said.

Ford, in a brief report accompanying
the council’s report, said, “The un-
derlying fact about our economy is that it
is steadily growing healthier.""’

The council painted a cautiously op-
timistic picture of an economy that is
experiencing a solid, slow recovery but
still facing many pitfalls.

The report was laced with warnings
that attempts to overstimulate the
economy would bring greater inflation
and threaten the recovery. It said in-
creasing federal deficits to create jobs
would squeeze private investment funds
out of the economy and “the expansion


could stall some time before employment
returns to an acceptable level.”

“What we need is a durable recovery —
not 4 boom that carries ‘the seeds of
renewed instability in prices, incomes
and employment,” the council said.

Inflation should moderate somewhat
during 1976, the council said, dropping
from its high of 12.1 per cent in 1974 and
7.3 per cent in 1976 to about 6 per cent
during this year.

The price of food and energy will not
continue their meteoric rise of the last
three years unless some unpredictable
problem arises, the council said.

Preliminary indications are for in-
creased food production this year, and
“food prices are not likely to add to in-
flationary pressures during the first half
of 1976.""

During 1975, the unemployment rate
peaked at 8.7 per cent in the spring, then
settled slightly to 8.5 per cent at the end of
the year. The council said this rate should
drop by about one percentage point
during 1976.

The “real” gross national product, or
GNP — the total output of goods and
services after inflation is taken into ac-
count -— should grow by 6 to 6% per cent in
1976 compared with declines for two

1976-22,Nov-04-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Jimmy
Carter, the victorious challenger, and
Gerald Ford, the vanquished
President, both exhausted by their
battle for the White House, are plan-
ning vacations before the rites of pas-
sage that mark the transfer of
presidential power.

Carter was meeting today with Vice
President-elect Walter F. Mondale,
who scheduled a flight te Plains, Ga.,
for their first conference since the
election.

The 52-year-old Georgia peanut

farmer and former governor, who
spent nearly two years in his pursuit of
the White House, said as he claimed
his victory in the wee hours of Wed-
nesday morning that he was pledging
himself to “the unification of our coun-
try.”
It will be up to the two winners, their
staffs and the staff of Ford’s White
House to work out details of the
transfer of the control of government
from the defeated Republican
president to the victorious president-
elect.

The margin of victory was a narrow
one, and a final tabulation of the
electoral vote still could not be made


more than 24 hours after the final vote
had been cast.

While the principals in the fight for
the right to Jead the United States into
its third century accepted the results
of Tuesday’s election and planned for
the orderly transfer of power, vote
counting continued in widely scattered
areas.

In two states, Ohio with 25 electoral
voles and Oregon with six, the results
in the presidential race remained too
close to call. Carter had such narrow
leads in both states that his advantage
in either could be overturned by ab-
sentee ballots still being tallied.

But the balloting in neither state
could change the outcome of the
election, which Carter had won in the
early hours of Wednesday. Without
counting the two states still listed as
uncertain, Carter carried 22 states and
the District of Columbia with a total of
272 electoral votes, two more than the
270 needed for election.

Ford carried 26 states with a total of
235 electoral votes.

Here was the popular vote total with
all the nation’s precincts reporting:
Carter 40,263,549 or 51 per cent.

Ford 38,512,666 or 48 per cent.

The numbers indicated that 53 per

1976-23,Jul-16-1976,"LONG BEACH, Calif. (UPI) — Pat Nixon is in serious
Condition in a hospital bed today, ‘‘moderately to severe-
ly paralyzed’ by a stroke that left her unable to walk or
talk normally as doctors labored to determine whether
her condition will deteriorate.

The wife of the former president was on the critical-
care floor at Long Beach Memorial Hospital — where her
husband came close to death 21 months ago — but a
neurologist said her life was in no immediate danger.

However, there was a possibility her condition could
grow worse, he cautioned, and a chance she may never
walk normally again.

Nixon, who rode in an ambulance with his wife and
their daughter, Julie Eisenhower, to the hospital from the
family home in San Clemente, did not speak to newsmen
about his wife’s illness.

But Dr. Jack M. Mosier, the specialist called in by the
Nixon family physician, said the former president was
“being very nice and being very realistic,’ and told him
“he wanted me to treat her like I would any other
patient.”’

In Chicago, former California Gov. Ronald Reagan told
reporters Nixon had told him by telephone that ‘‘her


condition is stabilized and that they are very hopetul, but
they won't really know — because of the nature of the
stroke — for some 48 hours’’ the seriousness of her
condition.

Nixon left the hospital late Thursday afternoon but
Mrs. Eisenhower stayed as her mother ate a light meal
and waited for the Nixons’ other daughter, Tricia Cox, to
arrive from New York. She reached the hospital shortly
after 8 p.m. and spent about ‘an hour with her mother. The
two daughters left together and refused to speak with
newsmen.

‘Mrs. Nixon is a very charming patient,’’ Mosier said,
‘a good intellect, bright, alert and is taking things very,
very well and very cheerfully.”

The former first lady was stricken Wednesday after-
noon while resting at her home and when she tried to
stand up discovered her left leg would not support her.

She ‘‘suspected’’ the cause of her trouble but went to
bed without telling anyone, Mosier said, explaining that


a stroke often impairs the victim's logic. She was ‘‘vis-
ibly sick’’ when she awakened Thursday morning.

Dr. John Lungren, the family physician, examined her
briefly at the Nixon estate and ordered her rushed to the
hospital 50 miles to the north. Mosier spoke to reporters
after a lengthy examination by both physicians.

He said Mrs. Nixon had suffered a stroke in the right
hemisphere of the brain, causing her to lose some control
of the muscles on the left side of her body.

‘We're hoping the stroke has stabilized,’’ he said. ‘‘If
the stroke doesn’t get any worse, she’s not going to die.
If it gets worse, well, people do die from strokes,”

Mrs. Nixon probably will be able to walk unsupported
if her stroke does not worsen and she recovers properly,
Mosier said.

He said she should be hospitalized about 10 days for
observation and tests to determine the cause of the stroke
— possibly high blood pressure or a blood clot in the
artery that carries blood from the heart to the brain.

1976-26,Dec-25-1976,"PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — President-
elect Carter is convening a series of
preinauguration meetings of his
cabinet at a secluded island planta-
tion, with discussions of possible tax
cuts and the general state of the
economy expected to be high on the
agenda.

Carter was scheduled to fly to St.
Simon's Island near Brunswick, Ga.,
aboard a commercial chartered
airliner today after spending a quict
Christmas with his family in Plains.

Vice President-elect Walter Mon-
dale and most of the new cabinet
members were to fly to the island
estate from Washington on an Air
Force jet.

Carter begins his three-day series
of meetings by conferring on
economic problems with Michael
Blumenthal, the Bendix Corp. chair-
man named Treasury secretary;
Thomas B. Lance, the Atlanta banker
chosen as director of the Office of
Management and Budget, and
Charles Schultze, the economist who
will be chairman of Carter's Council
of Economic Advisers.

The sessions with the cabinet
miembers, who take over the federal
government with Carter on Jan. 20,
were planned as free-wheeling and in-
formal. Carter aides said they were
designed to let the President-elect and
his appointees discuss policies and get
to know each other.

“This is the start of his treatment of
the cabinet officers as the principal
staff and the main means of carrying
out what he hopes to do in his ad-
ministration,’ said Rex Granum, a
Carter spokesman.

But the man Carter defeated in last
month's election says Carter pro-
bably will have trouble fulfilling his
campaign promises.

President Ford said in an ABC-TV
interview to be aired Jan. 2: “I think
he is going to find that youcan’tturna
switch and automatically increase
employment and decrease unemploy-


ment; he can't, by the waving of a
wand, eliminate a deficit, even over a
period of time.”

Meanwhile, Time magazine named
Carter as its “Man of the Year,” and
in an interview, Carter told the
magazine he hopes to complete an
agreement with the Soviet Union on
limiting strategic arms before the
current arms pact expires next Oc-
tober.

He said this could mean a
meeting with Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, ‘‘probably before
September'' and that “my own
preference would be in this country.”

On Middle East peace talks, Carter
said he thought he should meet with
some of the area’s leaders and then


“decide what public proposals we
aan make to initiate any peace
talks

The President-elect is scheduled
also to discuss the financial problems
of New York State and New York City
with Gov. Hugh Carey and Mayor
Abraham Beaoe in a private meeting
Tuesday.

Carter told his Sunday school class
at Plains Baptist Church that his
mother, ‘Miss Lillian"" Carter, would
remain hospitalized for two or three
days. She was hospitalized last
Wednesday, and Carter said she has
been suffering from ‘‘muscular
spasms"" in her left leg that cause her
pain when she walks.

1976-27,Sep-23-1976,"The two men who put their images
and ideas on the line today in the
first presidential debate of 1976 spent
the final hours studying their thick
briefing books. Behind Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter are weeks of
preparation. The stakes are high.

The setting is a Philadelphia theater
nearing the end of its second century;
the television audience is a nation of
voters mindful that a similar first en-
counter in 1960 was credited with
helping elect John F. Kennedy.

There was a coin flip Wednesday to
determine who receives the first
question.

As the quarter rolled to a halt, Barry
Jagoda, Carter's TV aide, correctly
called out ‘“‘heads,”’ giving the first
question to Carter and the closing
statement to Ford.

While the President met in
Washington with evangelist Billy
Graham, Carter made public an
apology to Lady Bird Johnson for citing
her husband, the late President Lyndon
B. Johnson, as an example of an Amer-
ican president who has lied.

Carter told Playboy magazine: “i
don't think I would ever take on the
same frame of mind that (former
Presidents) Nixon or Johnson did —
lying, cheating and distorting the
truth.”’

A Carter press aide said the
Democratic candidate telephoned Mrs.
Johnson in Texas on Tuesday night and
“expressed regrets that the quote
implied that Nixon and Johnson should
be treated in the same category.”

In recent speeches, Carter has
included Johnson in a litany of
Democratic presidents worthy of
approval.

Carter's aides also proclaimed, on
debate eve, that Carter's own poll
shows him leading Ford in states with
440 electoral votes, 170 more than
needed for election.

Ford's people, too, read good news in
the pre-debate sampling although it
was made by Patrick Caddell, Carter's
public opinion analyst.

“It would appear that Mr. Caddell’s
poll verifies that we're closing the gap
over the nation, but the only poll that is
going to count is the one that will be
taken in November,'’ said Ford
campaign spokesman William Greener.

Greener referred to Gallup and
Harris polls in August showing Ford
trailing Carter by 23 and 29 percentage
points respectively and noted that
the Caddell poll showed Ford trailing
by less than five points in states with
about 120 electoral votes, five to 10
points in states with 160 electoral votes
and by more than 10 points in states
with more than 160 electoral votes.

A White House visitor, John B.
Connally, also saw improvement in the
President's chances and said ‘‘how
people perceive these two candidates
and which they can best entrust with
the duties’ of president will decide the
election.

That public perception will be
sharpened by the debate. Such was the
importance of the event that the
training methods of the contestants
became a matter of scrutiny.

The White House, after days of
denials, acknowledged that the
President has rehearsed with aides who
peppered him with the kinds of
questions he might get in Philadelphia.

Press Secretary Ron Nessen said
some of the three or four days of dry
runs were in the White House theater
with former television comedian Don
Penny helping Ford.

Jimmy Carter is finding

boos as well as cheers on the
presidential campaign trail.

The Democratic nominee
drew heavy applause
“Tuesday night when he told
farmers in Des Moines, lowa,
that President Ford had
vetoed four times as many
bills as had Richard Nixon

“Anybody who is four times
as negative as Richard Nixon,
I think he has stayed there too
long,’ Carter said.

There also had been plenty
of applause during Carter's
speechnearlier Tuesday to
the American Legion's
national convention in Seattle
~~ until he paused and said:

“I want you to listen
caretully for | want you to
understand what I say. | do
not favor a blanket amnesty,
but for those who violated
Selective Service laws | in-
tend to grant a blanket par-
don.’'f

“No! No!"" shouted many of
the Legionnaires. Boos went
on for three minutes before
Legion Commander Harry
Weils gaveled the meeting to
order

But at the end of the talk, in
which Carter advocated a
strong military posture and a
possible resumption of the
dratt, the former submarine
commander got a standing
ovation

Hresident Ford, at his
mountain retreat im Vail,
Colo., proposed the debate
planned between him and
Carter contain four rounds
Shortly after Labor Day, he
said, they should debate

defense and later have


debates on domestic, foreign
and economic policy — in that
order.

Carter has yet to outline the
type of format he favors
except to say he would like to
have a cross examination by
each candidate and by
reporters. Representatives of
the two candidates will meet
in Washington Thursday to
discuss a format

Two federal agencies and
Congress must decide legal
questions about the debate,
including whether they can be
televised and who can pay tor
them

The Federal Election
Commission will determine
whether the debates, if
sponsored as proposed by a
group like the League of
Women Voters, can be
financed with private money.
The new federal election law
calls for the election cam-
paign to be financed solely
with federal funds.

Equal time provisions of
federal broadcast regulations
prohibit networks from
staging and televising
debates

1976-29,Sep-21-1976,"WASHINGTON (UPI) —
The cost of living rose 0.5 per
cent for the third straight
month in August, reflecting
higher prices for clothing,
gasoline, fruits and
vegetables, the Labor
wer ogee reported today.

consumer price in-
crease translates into an
annual inflation rate of 6 per
cent, larger than ad-
ministration economists had
expected. President Ford has
projected an inflation rate of 5
per cent for 1976.

Combined with a slight
decline in pay, the August
price increase cut into the
average worker's real
spendable earnings by 0.3 per
cent. Real earnings have
declined 0.6 per cent over the

st year.

Although food prices rose
only a slight 6.3 per cent
during August, the figures
indicated consumers were not
fully benefiting from recent
declines in food prices on the
wholesale market.

Service prices rose 0.6 per
cent for the third consecutive
month and the prices of goods
other than food also climbed
0.6 per cent for the second
straight month.

Administration economists
were anticipating that lower
food prices would bring some
moderation in the nation’s
inflation rate prior to the Nov.
2 election. Most public opinion
polls have identified infaltion
as the voters’ No, | concern

A decline in meat prices
during August, however,
failed to offset rising prices
for fruits, vegetables, ap-
parel, automobiles, gasoline,
motor oil, fuel oil and coal.

The Consumer Price Index
stood at 171.9 in August, an
increase of 5.6 per cent over a
year ago. This means that

and services costing
$100 in 1967, now sell for $171.9

Inflation began to heat up
last May after a virtual lull in
the early months of the year.
Consumer prices rose 0.6 per
cent in May, followed by three
consecutive monthly = in-
creases of 0.5 per cent.

Clothing and fuel prices
accounted for most of the
increase in non-food com-
modities. Gasoline and motor
oi! prices, which normally
decline in August, instead
rose 1.5 per cent. Fuel oil and
coal prices were up 1.8 per
cent,

Apparel prices rose 1.1 per
cent as new fall and winter
fashions showed up in the
stores. The biggest increases
were on clothing for women
and girls.

Used car prices continued
to climb, rising 1.4 per cent in
August. New car prices also
rose slightly and the cost of
driving a car jumped by a full
1 per cent.

Chowchilla, Calif. — Twenty-six children
and the driver of the school bus from which
they all vanished were still missing Friday,
apparently victims of a mass kidnaping, the
Madera County sheriff said.

Deputies and police scoured the
farmlands around Chowchilla, search
planes were out at dawn, volunteers joined
on horseback and the FBI was called in.
Parents gathered at the police station and
life ceased its normal routine along the two
blocks of the main street. Still, nearly 24
hours after the disappearance of the
children and their driver, there was no real
clue as to why or how or where they might
be

“It appears to be an abduction,” said
Sheriff Ed Bates. “We'll search the whole
state if we have to. And if we have to, we'll
search the entire United States.”

It was Thursday afternoon and the
children — ages 6 to 15 — were due home
from a swimming outing. The bus from the
Dairyland Union School District made
three stops, letting out three groups of
children, and had one more stop to make.

It never made it. The bus was found
Thursday night hidden in a stand of tall
bamboo in a dry canal about four miles
south of Chowchilla and 150 miles
southeast of San Francisco.

All-Points Bulletin

A statewide all-points bulletin was issued
by the sheriff's office this morning for up
to three vans — white with gold and blue
trim — believed traveling together along
Calif. 152, heading west from Chowchilla to
Los Gatos.

The bus was found about two miles from
the point where Calif. 152 passes near
Chowchilla. Los Gatos is a community near
the Pacific Coast about 50 miles south of
San Francisco and adjacent to San Jose.

There was no immediate information on
why the bulletin on the three vans was
issued. There were earlier reports that a
van had been seen along the school bus
route for the past few days.

Night Search

The San Joaquin Valley farmiands
around Chowchilla were searched
throughout a night shattered by thunder
and lightning. Joining the land and air
search were about 70 local volunteers,
some on horseback and some in cars and
trucks equipped with citizens band radios.

The only possible clues found to date
were two cotton swabs, gauze and a plastic
cup about 75 yards from the abandoned
school bus. But Bates said he was “not


satisfied’ the find was significant. “It
could ee
people taking photographs

Several sets of footprints and the light
tracks of what appeared to be one or two
heavy-duty vehicles were found leading out
of the canal where the bus was abandoned,
according to authorities.

Tire tracks were imposed on top of the
bus tracks, Bates said, indicating the
vehicles could have been waiting for the
bus. The ignition key was missing from the
bus. No signs of foul play were found in the
bus or the immediate area.

The children are students at the
Dairyland Union School, which school dis-
trict secretary Nita Hansen described as
“just a little country school.”

She said the bus driver, 55-year-old
Frank Edward Ray Jr., was ‘very
reliable’ and had been driving for the
school for 28 years. “You couldn't ask for a
nicer guy,” Mrs. Hansen said. “He was
born and raised here.”

Sheriff Bates, who set up a command
post at the Chowchilla Police Dept.,
speculated there were five possibilities: a
“deranged guy’’ who had kidnaped the en-
tire group; a “personal revenge, somebody
who wants to make the parents suffer,’ a
kidnaping ‘for money,” a “terrorist” plot;
or “some older kid on the bus took com-

1976-31,Jul-26-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Authorities
are puzzled about what motivated a
man who was fatally shot by a White
House guard on the mansion’s lawn
after scaling a fence, brandishing a
three-foot pipe and ignoring the
guard’s command to halt.

Washington police said the intruder,
Chester M. Plummer, raised the three-
foot pipe “‘in a threatening manner”’
and ignored repeated orders to halt
from the Executive Protective Service
guard on Sunday night.

The guard, Pvt. Charles A. Garland,
fired a single shot that hit Plummer in
the upper left chest and felled him
about 60 feet from the eight-foot fence
along Pennsylvania Avenue he had
just scaled.

The police said Plummer, a 30-year-
old Washington cab driver, reportedly
had a criminal record, but was not in-
volved in any previous intrusions on
the White House grounds.

A police sergeant said Plummer’s
motive was unknown. After talking
with Plummer’s parents, the sergeant
said, ‘‘He never indicated to them he
had any qualms with the President.”
Plummer, a bachelor, was estranged
from his parents, he added.

Secret Service spokesman Jack
Warner, asked whether the incident
would cause any security changes at
the White House, replied, ‘‘We con-
stantly review our security procedures
and find no problems with the outer
perimeter at this time.”

The White House recently installed
crash-proof gates costing $550,000. A
man crashed into the old gates in a car
on Christmas Day 1974, and in


February 1973 an AWOL soldier landed
a helicopter on the White House lawn
amid a hail of bullets from guards.
Last November an unarmed intruder
came within a few feet of Susan Ford,
the President’s daughter, on the first
of his three illicit entries onto the
grounds.

But no previous incident resulted in
death or serious injury.

A dispatcher at the Red Top Cab Co.
in Arlington, Va., where Plummer
worked, said, ‘‘He was really a nice
guy. He was quiet.”

Plummer was shot several hundred


feet from the White House, where
President Ford and his family were in
their second floor quarters. It was not
known whether Ford heard the shot,
but White House spokesmen say he
was informed of the incident.

An ambulance squad tried to revive
Plummer with heart massage on the
White House lawn. He stopped
breathing en route to George
Washington Hospital, where efforts to
revive him continued. He was
pronounced dead at 11:05 p.m., about
90 minutes after the shooting.

A Secret Service official said, ‘‘The


individual was observed earlier ... by
EPS officers, but did not make any
overt attempt at that time to arouse
suspicion as to a possible penetration.”

Plummer set off an alarm and was
“immediately detected’ by Garland
and another officer when he scaled the
fence, and Garland approached him
alone, the official said.

Garland, 25, will be placed on ad-
ministrative leave pending a routine
grand jury investigation, the police
said. He became an officer last
January in the EPS, the uniformed
branch of the Secret Service.

1976-32,Jul-20-1976,"-PASADENA, Calif. (AP) —
America’s Viking 1 spacecraft landed
today on a dusty plain of Mars to search
for life on the red planet. In a spec-
tacular space achievement, Viking be-
gan sending back razor-sharp photos of
the planet’s surface.

The pictures arrived dramatically,
appearing line-by-line on television
monitors after traveling 213 million
miles at the speed of light. The failure
of two earlier Soviet Mars landing
crafts had heightened the tension in the
project laboratory.

“The details are just incredible,”
said Dr. Thomas Mutch, head of the
lander imaging team.

“Tt just couldn’t be better,” he said
as the first picture, a portion of the
surface directly under one leg of the
lander appeared on television monitors
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It was of
the Chryse Planitia, the Gold Plain of
Mars — the smoothest place on a planet
marked by volcanic peaks and deep
valleys and craters.

Later, the unmanned threelegged
lander will make life-detection and soil
sampling tests. For. more than 100
years scientists have thought Mars


might harbor some form of life.

Scientists cheered and hugged each
other as the 1,300-pound craft radioed
that it touched down on Mars at 4:53
a.m. PDT. The signal took 19 minutes to
reach earth. For many, the
achievement was a childhood dream
come true — a Mars landing.

President Ford telephoned his
congratulations to the project
headquarters, calling the mission a
‘“‘wonderful and most remarkable
success.”

He said, ‘‘I think it’s amazing that in
the span of a single lifetime, the ex-
ploration of space has grown from the
dreams of very, very few individuals to
such a massive cooperative reality.”

Science fiction writer Ray Bradbury
was at JPL for the touchdown, his
dreams racing ahead of the Viking
mission.

“T know in the next 20 years we'll
have a manned landing on Mars —
eventually we’ll have colonized and
taken over the planet,’ Bradbury said.

The first picture showed an area of
soil strewn with what seemed to be
chunks of rock of varying sizes. Mutch
said it looked as though some of the


rocks had tails of dirt formed by the
rushing of strong Martian winds across
the surface.

Scientists had expected the landing
site, a low plain where streams may
once have run, would be covered by a
blanket of material deposited by the
water. Although the pictures showed a
rocky surface, the lander apparently
avoided any geologic hazards that
project officials had feared might im-
peril the touchdown.

In the corner of the first picture could
be seen one of Viking’s round metal
landing footpads. The rivets on the
footpad were visible and the footpad
cast an oval shadow in the late af-
ternoon sun as it rested on the soil
among the rocks, which Mutch
described as ‘‘a beautiful collection of
boulders.’’

The second picture was to be a
panoramic view of the Martian land-
scape, made by a camera on the lander
with the ability to sweep a long path
across the horizon.

Viking 1, the first of two unmanned
American spacecraft scheduled to land
on Mars this summer, was launched
last August 20.

1976-33,Oct-03-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Unemployment
jumped to its highest level in 11 months in
November, rising from 7.9 to 8.1 per cent,
while wholesale prices posted their third
big consecutive monthly increase, the
government said today.

The double-dose of economic news from
the Labor Department provided fresh
evidence of a sluggish economy and strong
inflationary pressures


The rise in unemployment heightened
the likelihood that President-elect Jimmy
Carter will push for tax cuts and other
measures to boost the economy early in
the new administration.

Carter has said he will consider
recommending a tax cut or increased
government spending aimed at creating
jobs to get the economy moving if the
slowdown continues much longer. In the
three weeks since he said that, there has
been little evidence that the slowdown is
over.

The Labor Department said 200,000
more Americans joined the jobless rolls in
November, raising the total to 7.8 million.
The unemployment rate, at 8.1 per cent,
was the highest level this year and the
peak since last December when it stood at
8.3 per cent.

Since last spring the economy has been
growing barely fast enough to provide jobs
for new entrants in the labor force, and the
unemployment rate gradually has in-
creased from last May when it reached a
post-recession low of 7.3 per cent.

The continued softness in the economy
along with rising prices could complicate
things for Carter as he tries to devise ways
of stimulating the growth without further
kindling inflation.

Not all the news in the job report was
bad. The Labor Department said em-
ployment rose last month as the labor
force expanded sharply following several
months of stability.

Total employment increased by more
than 350,000 in November to a new high of
88.1 million. Since the March, 1975,
recession low, the total number of
Americans at work has risen by four
million.

Most of the 200,000-increase in the
number of unemployed workers last


month occurred among adult men, whose
jobless rate edged up from 6.5 to 65 per
“cent, its highest point of the year.

The increases in both employment and
unemployment resulted from a sharp
growth in the labor force, which increased
in November by 560,000 to 95.9 million.

The unemployment rate is the per-
centage of the labor force that is out of
work. The labor force is the total of those
with jobs and those actively seeking jobs.

1976-34,Aug-21-1976,"AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) — President Ford's
challenge to a presidential campaign debate upstaged
Jimmy Carter and caught the Democratic nominee
and his staff by surprise.

The words ‘face-to-face’ debate were hardly out of
Ford's mouth when Carter's press secretary rounded
up reporters to say his candidate, too, was ready to
debate — a decision that could produce the first such

esidential campaign encounter since John F.
vennedy and Richard M. Nixon met in 1960 in a series
of four nationally televised debates.

Ford made his challenge Thursday night in his
SS nomination acceptance speech to the
tepublican National Convention and a_ national
television audience

“Tam ready and eager,”’ he told the delegates, “to
go before the American le and debate Jimmy
Carter. The people have a right to know where we
hae **

$s :

The debate challenge was not in the advance text of
Ford's s

White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford
had been considering issuing the challenge for the past
10 days. He said it was left out of the advance text of
the speech because Ford wanted to save it as a sur-
prise for the delegates.

Carter press secretary Jody Powell relayed Car-
ter's a ance — what Carter people called his
“counter challenge’’ — to fewer than a dozen ort.
vers watching Ford deliver his speech on a television
set beside a motel swimming poll.

His staff had scurried from room to room searching
for newspaper, wire service and television reporters.
Powell read the only available copy of the Carter


Statement

It wasn't suppose to happen that way. Carter had
intended to issue his own debate challenge to Ford
today at a 9 a.m. news conference in a carefully or-
chestrated response to the week-long GOP convention

But he decided to release his prepared statement as
soon as he learned of Ford's decision from television
commentators, who reported shortly before Ford gave
his speech that he would issue the debate challenge

Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, the Republican vice-
presidential candidate, visited Hamilton in 1972.
Journal-News writer Ron Reed rounded up points of
interest about that visit and Doles profile in a story on
today’s page 5.

The last bit of confetti has been thrown, now the
Republicans look toward campaigning. Stories on
those last hours in Kansas and the first hours on the
campaign trail appear on page 3.

Carter and his wife, Rosalyn, watched the Ford
s h Thursday night in their home on the outskirts
at nearby Plains.

Carter's red text said he will do his best to use
normal campaign methods — speeches, press releases
and advertising — ‘tg be sure the American people
understand my hopes and plans.

He a single debate or series of debates,
and said, “In the interest of an informed choice for the
American people, I believe the candidates have an
obligation to meet in debate before the people of this
country.”

Carter said he does not believe choosing a debate
foremat will be any problem, although he said he has
not committed himself to any of the debate proposals
he had previously received

1976-35,Apr-20-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The
volume of the nation’s total
economic output jumped 2.5 per
cent during the three months
ending in March and moved to
within a whisker of its
prerecession peak, the
government said today.

The Commerce Department
said the volume of the nation's
Gross National Product (GNP)
climbed at an annual rate of 7.5
per cent for the quarter,
compared to a 5 pet cent
growth rate during the previous
quarter,

The jump pushed the dollar
value of the GNP to an annual
rate of $1.616 trillion — 19.4 per
cent ahead of peak output
during the final quarter of 1973.
But inflation cut the quarter's
volume of goods and services to
two-tenths of a per cent below
the 1973 peak,

The Gross National Product
‘represents the total output of
goods and services in the
nation’s economy and is the
broadest gauge of the nation’s
economic performance.

The quarter’s increase is
within the range expected by
Commerce Secretary Elliot L.
Richardson and others, but at
the high end of the range. The
figures for the quarter are
preliminary and subject to
revision,

Richardson had said he
expected the rate of growth for
the first three months of the
year to be higher than for the
previous three months.

But, Richardson noted in an
article in “Commerce
America,’ his department's
monthly magazine, that the
GNP, after adjustment -for
inflation, would have to grow
by 8.5 per cent to retain the
prerecession peak.

“Tt is unlikely that output
increased that rapidly in the
first quarter, and therefore it


will be the second quarter
before the previous peak is
retained and surpassed,”
Richardson predicted.

Richardson said the latest
GNP figures should show a net
increase in business in-
ventories this time and “as
final sales continue to rise
inventory accumulation should
gain momentum during the
remainder of the year.”

Richardson said the new
GNP figures and other
economic indicators coming
out of the government should
prompt a favorable revision of
the administration's tnitial
economic expectations this
year.


The tatest 7.5 per cent
unemployment rate, for
example, is already below the
7.7 per cent initially expected to
be the average unemployment
rate for the year.

And there are some signs that
business inventories are now
about to fuel further economic
growth. Business stocks in
relation to sales are now at the
lowest level in nearly two
years. When business depletes
its stocks without replenishing
them, production capacity is
idled and workers are thrown
out of work. When stocks are
accumulating, workers are
busy supplying inventory goods
as well as those sold directly.

1976-36,Feb-26-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal
Trade Commission is investigating the
huge Blue Shield insurance system to
determine if physician control of the
72-million-member program stifles
competition and contributes to the
dramatic increase in health care costs
for all Americans.

Blue Shield now provides physician-
care insurance for 40 per cent of the
nation’s population and pays out over
$3 billion annually in doctor's fees, the
FTC said.

The FTC said today its nonpublic
investigation will encompass all of the
71 Blue Shield plans across the nation
as well as the National Association of
Blue Shield Plans.

Blue Shield officials said they would
cooperate with the FTC investigation.
They also said the investigation was
not evidence of any illegality and they
defended physician involvement with
Blue Shield.

FTC officials gave no details of the
planned investigation, except to say
they would study control of Blue Shield
by physicians and its impact on com-
petition and deliver of health-care
services to all Americans.

But it was learned that the agency is
concerned, among other things, that
the plan’s large share of the physician-
care business allegedly gives Blue
Shield a major voice in determining
the prevailing fees charged by
physicians in any given community.

There were indications the in-
vestigation would touch on contentions
that since medical doctors themselves
control the program, competition from
other health plans not administered by
doctors is interfered with.

Physician control of Blue Shield
varies from plan to plan but physicians
involved in administration of Blue
Shield basically are determining the


amounts that Blue Shield will pay
them for services performed for
subscribers.

A three-month investigation last
year by The Associated Press con-
cluded that Blue Shield’s practices
encourage physicians to raise their
bills.

The national Blue Shield association
requires local boards of directors to
have a majority of ‘‘public’’ members
representing subscribers instead of


doctors. But The AP investigation
found that many of these ‘“‘public’’
members are chosen by doctors and
hospitals rather than by subscribers.

Government figures show that
doctors’ fees have risen 85 per cent in
the past 10 years, compared to a 68 per
cent increase in the over-all cost of
living. The AP investigation concluded
that the soaring medical costs resulted
in part from the failure of Blue Shield
to impose cost controls on physicians.


It has been indicated the FTC will
attempt in its probe to determine if
doctors involved with Blue Shield are
in a conflict-of-interest situation in
setting the formulas that establish the
fees they and other doctors are to be
paid for their services.

The FTC said, however, that the
investigation of Blue Shield does not
imply that there are any violations of
the law and the probe could end
without any action being taken by the
government.

1976-37,Jul-22-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress,
with an attack on unemployment as a
major goal this election year, today
overrode President Ford's veto of a
$3.95-billion public works jobs bill,
enacting it into law.

The House then overrode Ford's veto

BA, $3.3-billion military construction

ill.

Final action on the jobs bill came in
the House, which overrode Ford's veto
by a vote of 310 to 96, or 39 more than
the required two-thirds. Fifty seven
Republicans joined 253 Democrats in
voting to override. Voting to sustain
were 15 Democrats and 81 Republicans.

The House vote on the military
construction bill was 270 to 131, or two
more than the required two-thirds. The
bill now goes to the Senate for a con-
sideration of an override attempt.
Congress has overriden the President
nine times and sustained him 14 times.

The issue on the military con-
struction bill was Ford's objection to a
provision strengthening congressional)
ability to review Pentagon decisions to
close or greatly reduce military in-
stallations that are a major source of
civilian employment. The President
said this was an excessive limitation on
his powers.

The Democratic-controlled Congress
and the Democratic candidates for
president and vice president have made
an assault on joblessness a major
election-year issue.

The Senate voted 73 to 24 Wednesday
to override Ford's veto of the public
works bill.

House Majority Leader Thomas
O'Neill and other Democratic leaders


had predicted they would have no
difficulty winning the jobs bill
override.

But O'Neill had not been so confident
about overriding Ford's veto of the
military construction authorization.

Supporters say the bill will create
jobs in the construction industry
because it authorizes $2 billion in
grants to state and local government
for public works construction projects


that can be started in 90 days.

They say the 90,000 state and local
government jobs will be saved by a
$1.25-billion authorization in the bill
for antirecession grants to maintain
government services in areas with high
unemployment.

Democratic leaders, particularly in
the House, set creation of more jobs as
their major legislative goal at the start
of this year.

1976-38,Sep-30-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP)—The House voted
today to override President Ford's veto of
a $56.6 billion appropriation bill for the
departments of Labor and Health,
Education and Welfare.

The vote was 312 to 93, 42 more than the
two-thirds needed to override.

It left the final decision to the Senate,
which was expected to act promptly.

Ford had said the bill was inflationary,
calling for $4 billion more spending than he
had recommended for the departments.

Supporters of the appropriation said
Ford's budget made no provision for rising
costs and would have forced cuts in
programs for children, the disadvantaged
and the elderly.

The House then moved toward
consideration of a revenue sharing
measure that could be the key to
determine whether Congress meets its
weekend deadline for adjournment.

Ford said Wednesday he will sign or veto
two different jobs bills only after Congress
acts on the revenue sharing measure, for
which he has pushed hard.

The two jobs bills awaiting presidential
action are a $3.7-billion measure for public
works construction and legislation extend-
ing 260,000 public service jobs in state and
local governments through the coming
fiseal year.

Because these bills will be killed by a
pocket veto if Congress adjourns and Ford
doesn't act 10 days after he received them,
supporters of the measures want Ford to
sign or veto them. If Ford vetoes them,
Congress then could attempt an override
before adjourning this weekend.

Ford said Wednesday he will make
decisions on the two bills if Congress
approves the revenue-sharing bill that
comes before the House today. That


measure would provide $25.5 billion in
federal revenue-sharing funds to cities,
states and counties through 1980.

House Majority Leader Thomas P.
O'Neill said Wednesday that Congress will
stay in session beyond Friday if that is
necessary to prevent a pocket veto.

The veto of the HEW-Labor bill was
Ford's 59th in his 49 months in office. Of
the 59, Congress has overridden 11.

House voted today to override
President Ford's veto of a $6.1-
billion jobs bill, sending the
issue to the Senate for a final
decision on whether it will
become law.

The vote was 319-98, which
was 41 votes more than the two-

The issue was considered
extremely close in the Senate,
which is expected to take up the
veto issue later today.
Republican Leader Hugh Scott

pected Ford’s veto to be
sustained, but Democrats were
cautiously optimistic.

During debate in the House,
which originally passed the bill
by more than a four-to-one
margin, Republicans em-

sustained, members still would
have a chance to vote on a
substitute, limited measure.

1976-41,May-05-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The House
voted 301 to 101 Tuesday to override
President Ford’s veto of a bill providing
$125 million to help the states meet new
federal standards for child day care
centers.

The measure now goes to the Senate,
where a vote on overriding the veto is
expected Wednesday.

In vetoing the bill last month, Ford said
it would ‘‘perpetuate rigid federal child
day-care standards for all the states and
localities in the nation, with the cost to be
paid by the federal taxpayer.”’

Ford urged Congress to enact his own
program under which states would
establish and enforce their own day care
standards.

Ford has vetoed 48 bills and has been
overriden eight times.

The day care centers look after the
children of working mothers and have
been cited as one way women with small
children can get off welfare rolls and into
jobs without leaving their children
unattended. ;

The House vote on the bill was 33 votes
more than the required two-thirds
majority to override the veto.

When the roll was called 243


Democrats were joined by 58
Republicans on the winning side, over-
powering 24 Democrats and 77
Republicans.

The bill would suspend until July 1 a
requirement that child day-care centers,
to qualify for federal funds, must meet
federal standards on staff persons on


hand for children aged six weeks to six
years old. A previous suspension,
enacted last October, expired Feb. 1.

The staffing requirements range from
one child per staff member for the
youngest children to seven youngsters
per staff member for children between
four and six years old.

The House today voted to

gasoline.

The vote was 307 to 101, or
35 more than the two-thirds

veto issue goes to the Senate.

The President vetoed the
bill Monday, saying private

said development of a better
battery is crucial, and it
would be premature for the
government to engage in a

Aides to both Ronald Reagan and President
Ford claim a majority of the 30-person
Mississippi Republican delegation. Everyone
else apparently must wait until the GOP con-
vention next month to find out who's right.

Despite intense pressure from _ both
Republican camps, the 30-member Mississippi
delegation voted Sunday to go to Kansas City
uncommitted.

Meanwhile, Reagan promised an “important
statement’ today; Ford, at the White House,


entertained a Maryland delegation already
committed to him, and Jimmy Carter and his
vice presidential candidate, Sen. Walter F.
Mondale, were deep in strategy talks.

THE FORMER California governor said he
would have an “important statement”’ at 12 noon
EDT today, but the aide who announced it had
“no inkling at all’’ what it would be about.

He planned to make the statement in
California, and allow his campaign manager,
Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., to answer questions
about it in Washington afterwards.


Both Ford and Reagan aides described the
Mississippi decision as crucial. Clarke Reed,
Mississippi GOP chairman and a Reagan
backer, said the state is ‘‘very important, maybe
crucial’ to each side. Ford leader Gil Car-
michael said it was ‘‘very critical,’ particularly
for Reagan.

Top Ford aide Richard Cheney said, ‘‘we're
trying to work it out’’ for the President to visit
Mississippi next Friday to seek support

BY UPI's TALLY, the state has 25 for Reagan,
3 for Ford and 2 uncommitted, but Ford backers


said they were gaining strength there and might
have the majority needed to swing the entire
delegation to the President under a unit rule.

It would have been enough to give Ford more
than the 1,130 votes he needs for nomination.
Again according to the UPI scoreboard, the
President now has 1,121 delegates to Reagan's
1,057. There are 81 uncommitted.

Ford, meanwhile, hosted the Maryland
delegation — which is committed to him — at the
White House today and invited the Pennsylvania
delegation. mostly committed to him, on
Thursday .

1976-44,Nov-15-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP)—Con-
sumers food prices next year
could rise an average of 3 to 4
per cent, the same rate of in-
crease as this year, a top Agri-
culture Department forecaster
said today.

This year’s 3 per cent in
crease in food prices has been


the smallest year-to-year climb
in five years, following leaps in
both 1973 and 1974 of 14.5 per
cent and an 8.5 per cent in
crease last year.

In terms of what a family
spends on food, considering
both groceries and meals eaten
out, the increases have meant


that what cost $10 in 1972 now
costs $14.65. The forecast for
1977 means that the same $10
worth of food will cost between
$15.09 and $15.24 a year from
now.

Rex F. Daly of the Agricul-
ture Department's Economic
Research Service, who made
the forecast, said ‘tthe band of
uncertainty is wide’’ when it
comes to predicting farmers’
incomes. In the end, net farm
income for 1977 could be pretty
much the same as the 1976 av-
erage, Daly said.

The tentative forecasts came
in remarks prepared for the
opening of USDA's annual four-
day conference on the outlook
in the coming year for farmers,
farm families and grocery buy-
ers.

Daly's predictions, based on
normal weather and no _ sur-
prises in the world agricultural
situation, are the first official |
ones from the department to
cover all of 1977, instead of just
the first six months. |

Daly said his projection on_
food prices rests mainly on an_
anticipated rise of 5 to 6 per.
cent next year in the cost of |
eating out at restaurants and |
other away- -from-home _ spots.
Those prices have gone up_
about 7 per cent this year over |
last.

Restaurant and other eatery |
prices account for about 20 to_ |

1976-45,Nov-17-1976,"PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — President-
elect Jimmy Carter will meet with
Secretary of. State Henry A.
Kissinger here Saturday for a
briefing on foreign policy matters
and will confer with President Ford
in Washington next week, it was
announced today.

Ford and Carter agreed in a
telephone call Monday night to have
their staffs work out arrangements
for their meeting. The day for the
session has not been decided yet,
White House spokesman John
Carlson said.

Carlson said Carter put in a
telephone call to Ford as the
President returned aboard Air
Force One on Monday from a
California vacation. Ford returned
the call when he arrived back at the
White House.

Carter’s staff said Kissinger will
be accompanied Saturday by
Lawrence Eagleburger, the un-
dersecretary for management at the
State Department who is handling
the department liaison with Carter
during the transition from the Ford
administration.

Eagleburger was scheduled to
meet later today at the State
Department with W. Anthony Lake,
who has been designated by Carter
to head his foreign policy transition
team. Lake is expected to see
Kissinger before the secretary
travels to Georgia.

Vice President-elect Walter
Mondale, who will be in Plains on
Friday for a meeting between
Carter and CIA Director George
Bush, also will attend the Carter
briefing with Kissinger.

The meeting is the first between
Carter and the secretary of state,
whom Carter and Mondale
frequently criticized during the
presidential campaign. The session,
scheduled for 10:30 a.m. EST, marks

1976-46,Dec-10-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) —
President-elect Carter met
today with housing advisers to
discuss ways to add zip to the
economy by spurring the con-
struction industry

The advisers have drawn up


a series of options that the in-
coming administration could
use to stimulate the lagging
construction business.

Carter also was meeting in
separate sessions with
advisers on the economy
labor, transportation, health.
education and welfare.
energy, agriculture and
government reorganization
In addition, he also planned
more interviews with
potential Cabinet appointees

One of the housing options
would have Carter ask Con-
gress to appropriate up to $5
billion to subsidize interest
rates on home mortgages. ac-
cording to a source familiar
with the thinking of the presi-
dent-elect's aides.

Legislation already on the
books in the form of the Emer.


gency Housing Act of 1975 au-
thorizes $10 billion to subsidize
mortgage interest rates for
certain buyers

However, the Ford adminis-
tration took advantage of the
law only to the extent of
obtaining the appropriation of
$5 billion, meaning there is
another $5 billion available for
spending. By asking Congress
to appropriate this money,
Carter could avoid the delay
inherent in asking the
lawmakers to approve an
entirely new housing
program.

A knowledgeable source
said more money for the
mortgage subsidy program
would have a ‘‘dramatic”™
impact on the housing
industry

He also said it would be a


‘fantastically effective tool”
to stimulate the over-all
economy by boosting
employment in the building
trades and in related
industries that produce things
like refrigerators, light
switches, curtain rods and
nails for new homes

Carter would have to decide
whether single-family or
multifamily buildings should
benefit from this program

Other options expected to be
presented to Carter include
ways to cut red tape in federal
housing programs so that
money now clogged in the
federal pipeline can be flushed
out into the marketplace
where it can be put to use.

Carter's meetings with his
housing aides and later with
potential cabinet appointees


and advisers were in Blair
House, the presidential guest
house across the street from
the White House. Carter will
visit the Pentagon on Friday
before returning to Georgia.
He flew to Washington on
Wednesday afternoon from
Atlanta

Among those scheduled to
meet with Carter are Clark
Clifford, secretary of defense

tration, Rep. Barbara Jordan,

1976-47,Jul-20-1976,"PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — Jimmy: Carter today
was to hold his first meeting since the
Democratic National Convention with the ad-
visers who helped him capture his party's
presidential nomination.

The meeting was set up to discuss campaign
strategy and to map plans for the transition te a
possible Carter presidency. . .

“In essence, they will talk about how to get
from where we are now to a Carter ad-
ministration,” an aide said.

Those at the meeting with the presidential
nominee were to include campaign manager
Hamilton Jordan; Stu Eizenstat; Jack Watson,
an Atlanta attorney handling transition plans;
and Dick Moe, administrative assistant to Sen.
Walter Mondale, Carter's vice presidential
running mate.


The role of Mondale in the fall campaign was
high on the meeting’s agenda.

Watson, chairman of the Georgia Board of
Human Resources, which oversees health and
welfare programs, planned to report to Carter
on his search for people to serve in a Carter
administration, including possible cabinet
members, an aide said.

Carter has stayed at home since his return
from the convention in New York City last
Friday, venturing out only to Sunday school and
ehurch and to, visit his sister, Gloria Spann, on
Monday.

The AFL-CIO’s Executive Council endorsed
Carter on Monday, and the former Georgia
governor telephoned George Meany, the labor
fadoeration's president. to thank him.

1976-49,Jul-20-1976,"WASHINGTON — AP — The Gross
National Product, the broadest
measure of the nation’s economic well-
being, registered a sharp drop in the
growth rate during the spring quarter,
the government reported today. The
drop was attributed primarily to a
stabilization of business inventory
accumulation.

The Commerce Department said the
GNP grew at an annual rate of 4.4 per
cent in volume for April through June,
compared to a 9.2 per cent annual rate
of growth in the year’s first quarter.

Despite the decline in the rate of
growth, most economists say they feel
the drop will be temporary.

The GNP represents the nation’s
total output of goods and services and
is a key determinent of how many new
jobs the economy generates as well as
the economic status of all Americans.

The Commerce Department said the
slower growth rate was accompanied
by a quickening of inflation. Prices as
measures in the GNP accounts, which
include the prices of all goods and
services in the economy rather than
just consumer prices, were up 5 per
cent at an annual rate in the second
quarter. The inflation rate in the first
quarter was 3 per cent.

A sharp drop in the growth rate had
been expected by Ford administration
economists for at least a month.

Despite the slower growth rate, the
GNP figures contained some en-
couraging signals. Demand in the
economy, or the level of final sales,
actually grew at a faster pace—4.7 per
cent at an annual rate. Final sales had
climbed at a 3.7 per cent rate in the

first quarter.


The reason that final sales managed
to climb faster while the economy as a
whole was growing more slowly is that
the sharp boost in inventory ac-
cumulation of the first quarter was
absent.

Businessmen satisfied demand in
1975 from inventories because they
were overstocked with goods and raw
materials in their storehouses. Then in
the first three months of this year they
suddenly began building inventories
again.

That inventory building quickly
stimulated production and created
new jobs, but in the second quarter of
this year inventory accumulation was
at a slightly slower pace, slowing down
creation of new jobs.

Inventories grew by $13.3 billion in
the second quarter compared to a $14.8
billion growth in the first quarter, the
government said.

The total value of GNP at an annual
rate in the second quarter was placed
at $1,673 billion.

Simultaneous with release of the
GNP figures, the Commerce Depart-
ment reported that total personal
income of Americans grew by the
smallest margin in 11 months during
June. Personal income for the month
was at annual rate of $1,368.9 billion,
an increase of $6. billion, or four-tenths
of 1 per cent, over May.

That compared with a $10.4 billion
advance in May and was the smallest
monthly gain since personal income
dipped last July.

The GNP accounts showed that
disposable personal income, which is
total income after deduction of taxes,
amounted to $5,452 per person.

1976-50,Jul-22-1976,"PASADENA (AP) ~— The first
Martian weather report shows nippy
morning temperatures of 122 degrees
below zero on the Red Planet, under
skies not blue but pink.

Dust particles floating in the thin
atmosphere scatter sunlight to paint
the sky pink, scientists explained today,
even though it looked an earthly blue in
Viking 1’s first color picture.

“Tt is red, but not as red as the
surface,” said Dr. Carl Sagan.

The color was false in the first picture
because Viking’s cameras have not yet
been adjusted to repraduce colors on
Mars with perfect accuracy, said
project officials.


A more serious problem was also
revealed late Wednesday. The
seismometer designed to detect
marsquakes did not turn on properly
after Tuesday’s landing.

Unless if can be fixed by radio
commands from earth, the instrument
will not be able to carry out its work of
recording quakes and probing the
interior of the planet, said Deputy Mis-
sion Director Lou Kingsland.

Scientists had hoped to have the use
of seismometers aboard both Viking 1
and its twin, Viking 2 — due for a
landing later this summer — in order to
determine the location of any
marsquakes. If only one seismometer
works properly, only the number, not


the direction of the quakes can be
registered.

Dr. Seymour Hess, meteorology
investigation team leader, said the
weather station aboard the robot lander
recorded temperatures ranging from
122 below zéro Farenheit to 22 below,
although the latter was not the highest
temperature of the day.

He said there were light winds
shifting from the east to the southwest
during Viking's first Martian night. The
highest wind speed was 15 miles per
hour, far gentler than the winds of
several hundred miles per hour known
to blow on the planet.

Sagan, a member of Viking’s lander
photography team, said another

1976-51,Sep-17-1976,"WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
House voted 280 to 65 today to
create a new committee to reopen
investigations into the deaths of
John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr.

Speaker Carl Albert said he
would name retiring Rep. Thomas
N. Downing, D-Va., to head the 12-
member committee for the rest of
this year. It would have to be
recreated when the new Congress
is seated in January.

Downing  - promised his
colleagues that the committee’s
efforts would be focused only on
the Kennedy and King deaths,
although the resolution
establishing the panel allows it to
look into ‘‘any others (deaths) the
select committee shall deter-
mine.’’ He asked for $250,000 in
funds for this year.

Most of the opposition to the
measure centered around
authority to look into other deaths.

Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., said it
“gives the committee enormous
powers to ge into any assassination
a © any person in the
world

Rep. John Anderson, R-Ill., said
the authority was included to allow
the committee to get into any other


deaths which may have been
associated with the Kennedy and
King assassinations.

He mentioned the deaths of Sam
Giancana and John Roselli, two
alleged Mafia leaders, who were
killed after it was disclosed they
were associated with a CIA plot to
kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
Other allegations have been made
that the plot on Castro may have
been connected with the
assassination of Kennedy in 1963.

Downing said several—other-
recent revelations have raised
enough questions in the minds of
the American people concerned
about whether proper _in-
vestigations were conducted into
the two assassinations. ‘‘We have
to get started sometime and this
thing has been put off too long ...
We don’t know the complete
truth.”’

Albert, also retiring after this
session, told newsmen earlier it
would be up to his heir apparent,
Rep. Thomas O’Neill, D-Mass., to
name the new chairman when the
committee is recreated next year.
It was expected to be Rep. Henry
B. Gonzalez, D-Tex., who along
with Downing has led the fight to
establish the panel.

the White House while Jimmy Carter is
resting and studying issues after offering
his first detailed suggestion for
reorganizing the government

Their first nationally televised debate,
on economic and domestic issues, will be
held in Philadelphia on Thursday night
Two more Ford-Carter debates, on other
issues, will follow.

Presidential advisers say Ford is
rehearsing with his aides acting as
reporters who fire questions at him
Aides say the exercise is aimed at honing
his responses to questions likely to be
asked before the national television
audience.

Ford aides say he is hoping to dispel
doubts about his intelligence and ability
‘He wants to appear informed, decisive
and experienced while picturing Carter
as the opposite,” one aide said.

For his dress rehearsal, Ford planned
to perform before videotape cameras
that would allow him to replay and refine
his responses.

Carter's aides said the Democratic
nominee planned no special preparations
for the debate other than to rest and read
briefing books designed to keep him
abreast of the issues.

Although Carter aides said the
Democratic nominee planned no dress
rehearsals before the debate, he does
plan to visit the site of the debate tc
familiarize himself with the setting

before he actually arrives to face Ford o1
Thursday night.

Meanwhile, the sponsors of the debate
the League of Women Voters, denied the
the second debate, which is set for Oct. ¢


will be in San Francisco's War Memorial
Veterans Building

The president of the board that
operates the building had said the debate
would be there. But a spokesman for the
league said that while San Francisco is
being considered along with other cities,
the veterans building has been ruled out
for technical reasons

Both Carter's running mate, Sen
Walter Mondale, and Ford's running
mate, Sen. Bob Dole, planned to cam-
paign today.

As Carter relaxed at home in Plains,


Ga., his campaign organization issued
the first details of what the Democratic
nominee has promised would be an
overhaul of the federal bureaucracy

In a statement, Carter said he would
abolish four existing agencies that now
deal with energy questions. replacing
them with a Cabinet-level department.
He said he would abolish the Federal
Energy Administration, the Federal
Power Commission, the Energy
Research and Development Administra.

upheld the program by a 2 to 1 vote in 1974.

Seventeen college receive money under
the program. Three of them — Notre Dame
and Loyola in Baltimore and Mount Saint
Mary’s in Emmitsburg, Md. — are af-
filiated with the Roman Catholic Church.

The Supreme Court was asked whether
the program amounts to a law ‘‘respecting
an establishment of religion” and conse-
quently forbidden by the First Amendment.

Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in an opinion
in which Chief Justice Warren E. Burger
and Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. joined, said
the Maryland program met a three-fold test
of the constitutionality of state aid to
church-related institutions, as outlined in a
1971 case.

In the 1971 ruling, the court said the aid
must have a secular purpose, must not have


the primary effect of advancing religion,
and must not foster an excessive govern-
ment entanglement with religion.

The Supreme Court’s opinion said the first
part of the test was not an issue because it
was agreed that the purpose of the
Maryland program was the secular one of
supporting private higher education
generally.

The justices also said the program does
not have the primary effect of advancing
religion.

They said the colleges were similar to
those involved in another 1971 case in which
the court upheld a federal law providing
construction grants for both public and
private colleges. The same 1971 ruling
barred the use of federal money for any
facility when the funds were to be used for
secretarian instruction or religious worship
or as part of a school or department of
divinity.

The three justices also agreed with the
lower court that the program did not ex-
cessively entangle the government with
religion.

They said that although the state might
have occasion to audit the church-related
schools to see if they are using the money
properly, this kind of audit was not likely to
lead to any greater entanglement than the
audits already made for purposes of college
accreditation.

Justices Byron R. White and William H.
Rehnquist also voted to uphold the program
but said they did so only on the basis that it
had a secular purpose and that its primary


effect was ‘‘neither to advance nor inhibit
religion.”

White and Rehnquist maintained that the
third part of the threefold test — whether
the program fostered excessive en-
tanglement — was superflous.

Dissenting Justices William J. Brennan
Jr. and Thurgood Marshall said they agreed
with the dissenter in the lower court, U.S.
Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. of Alexandria,
Va., that the Maryland program ‘“‘does in
truth offend the Constitution by its provision
of funds, in that it exposes state money for
use in advancing religion, no matter the
vigilance to avoid it.”’

Justices Potter Stewart and John Paul
Stevens dissented in separate opinions.

1976-54,Jun-28-1976,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) —- All of the
passengers and crew aboard a hijacked
Air France jetliner left the plane today
but were still under control of the
Palestinian hijackers in an airport
lounge, a British diplomatic spokesman
said.

“The plane is empty,” said the
spokesman for the British High Com-
mission, which is similar to an embassy.

He said everybody was gathered in a
transit lounge at the old Entebbe airport,
which is now used by the Ugandan
military, but did not say what was hap-
pening in negotiations for release of the
256 hostages.

French government sources in Paris
said Ambassador Pierre Renard, who
was at the airport with Ugandan
President Idi Amin, had firm instructions
to seek the release of everybody aboard
without discrimination on the basis of
nationality.

About 80 Israelis and at least nine
Americans were reported aboard the Tel
Aviv-Paris flight.

The Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine claimed
responsibility for the hijacking, but the
number of hijackers was not known.

Uganda radio broadcast a long
statement it said was made by the
hijackers condemning France as an
imperialist enemy of Arabs. The
statement also attacked the United
States, Israel, Egypt and Syria.

The French Embassy said the hijackers
asked for food and water for the
passengers after the plane reached here
with just half an hour’s fuel left in the
tanks.

An Air France spokesman in neigh-
boring Kenya said the hijackers had
presented written demands to the
Ugandan government but that they were
in Arabic and officials were awaiting a
translation.

The Israeli government has been
concerned the hijackers would try to hold
the Israelis for special ransom, but Radio
Israel reported after a telephone call to
Amin’s palace that there was no in-
dication of that.

Asked whether Israeli passengers


man at the palace was quoted as saying,
“Of course. Yes, why not?”

A pregnant woman allowed to leave the
plane when it stopped at Benghazi, Libya,
left there for London today after medical
treatment and an overnight rest. The
Tripoli-based Arab Revolution News
Agency said Patricia Suzan, a 30-year-
old Briton, was allowed off the plane
because she was hemorrhaging.

The plane was hijacked over Greece


during a flight Sunday from Tel Aviv to
Paris.

Middle East hijackers, even when they
surrender to authorities, usually get little
punishment. Those ending up in the
Middle East or North Africa often go free
or get light house arrest while a number
of those imprisoned in Europe have been
freed when Palestinian guerrilla
colleagues hijacked other planes and
demanded their release.

1976-55,Jul-19-1976,"CHOWCHILLA, Calif. (AP) — The
motive is still a mystery. But the
methods used by three silent, masked
men who kidnaped 26 children and their
bus driver make one thing clear — it
was a crime planned out to the fullest,
months in advance.

But it didn’t work. The children
escaped.

Still, that the captors could snatch a
busload of mostly tiny children in
daylight from a town where everyone
seems to know everyone else, and then
frustrate extensive search efforts by
FBI, state and local law officers for
more than 24 hours, testifies to their
thorough preparation.

When the plan was hatched is
unknown. As far back as November
1975, however, one of the suspects is
known to have bought three govern-
ment surplus vans one of which
authorities have traced to the kidnap-


ing. He paid with cash.

Two of the three he bought were
never registered. The other was
registered two days before the crime in
Los Gatos, near San Jose. Because of
that, investigators said they had to
search for records of the van by hand
since the information hadn't been filed
in the Department of Motor Vehicles
computer.

The name and San Jose address the
van was registered under turned out to
be phony, according to Madera County
Sheriff Ed Bates.

The vans were well equipped for a
flight from the scene of the crime. They
carried:

—CB radios, ideal for monitoring
police activity, but made even more
useful by the gabby ‘‘CB volunteers”’
who blasted out from Chowchilla nearly
every tidbit of information known about
the investigation.


—Painted windows, so no one could
see out — or in — and a tent-like tarp
made the roundabout route to the
gravel pits 100 miles away a mystery to
those inside.

—A good supply of extra gasoline
which kept the kidnapers from having
to pull into a service station and taking
the risk of an attendant being tipped off.

California Highway Patrolmen had
quickly alerted gas stations on the
major routes in the San Joaquin Valley
about the kidnaping and had told them
to report any suspicious looking vans.

The nearby creekbed where the bus
was taken made an ideal hiding spot.
Authorities said they could not see the
bus at all from the road during daylight
hours. It took a hastily organized air
search to spot the big yellow bus in a
thicket — and just before dark.

In the gravel pit near Livermore, the
kidnapers had an excellent hideout.

The children were buried for nearly
18 hours in a World War II vintage
military moving van about 25 feet long.
It was buried in a spot in the quarry
that was not being worked. The spot
was surrounded by brush up to six feet
tall.

Tests of soil samples taken from the
site show the truck had been buried
there less than a year, Alameda County
investigators said. They added that
there are numerous back roads to the
spot and kidnapers could have easily
driven in to work on the cavern at night
without being seen.

1976-56,Jul-24-1976,"SAN LEANDRO, Calif. (UPI) —
Three young men from wealthy
families, described by police as arm-
ed and dangerous, were hunted today
in connection with the kidnaping of 26
‘children and their driver from a
school bus in Chowchilla.

An all-points bulletin was flashed to
law enforcement agencies across the
country Thursday night, ordering the
arrest of the trio ‘‘on probable cause”’
for last week's abduction in the small
San Joaquin Valley town of
Chowchilla.

Though warrants were not yet
issued, Alameda County Sheriff Tom
Houchins said ‘‘I will seek arrests
warrants immediately,’’ adding he
would go to court for the warrants
this morning.

The three suepects ~~ identified as
Fred Newhall Woods, 25, James L
Schoenfeld, also 25, and his brother,
Richard, 22 — were described as arm-
ed and dangerous.

Houchins, whose department issued
the bulletin at its substation in San


Leandro after a search of the Woods’
family estate across San Francisco
Bay in the fashionable community of
Portola Valley, said the alert was a
result of ‘late developments this
afternoon.’’ He also said the search
was ‘‘accelerating.""’

Woods’ father owns the quarry in
nearby Livermore where the kidnap
victims were held in a buried truck.
The kidnaping occurred Thursday,
and the victims dug their way to
safety Friday night.

Houchins also said law enforcement
officers in two counties, ‘‘and
possibly three,’’ were searching for
the suspects. One county was identi-
fied as Santa Clara where clothing of
the victims was found off a lonely
mountain road.


SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (UPI) — State
police said today they had a citizen's
report the three men sought in the
California bus kidnaping of 26
children may have been in Jackson-
ville, Ill,, about 8 p.m. Thursday.

A man telephoned state police
headquarters at 5 a.m. today to say he
saw the three men at a service station
in Jacksonville in a 1974 or 1975 blue
Chevrolet. He said they appeared to
be heading east on U.S. 36 toward
Springfield.

Jacksonville is 35 miles due east of
Springfield and about 70 miles north
of St. Louis.

Trooper Terry Warden said a
bulletin was put out on police
networks in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio
to be on alert for the three men.

Warden said the caller, who was not
identified, apparently did not connect
the three men he saw Thursday night
= the California men until early

y.


Another county was Sierra, north of
Sacramento, where the trio was
arrested in October, 1974, for joy
riding and petty theft. Authorities
said all successfully completed proba-
tion there.

Houchins, asked the motive of the
bizarre kidnap, told newsmen, ‘‘I
have no idea.’’ He also said it was not
known when the three suspects were
last seen — by friends or parents.

The APB said Woods is six feet tall,
weighs 145 pounds, has brown hair
and blue eyes. The elder Schoenfeld
also is six feet tall, weighs 170 pounds
and has red hair and blue eves. His
younger brother is 5-feet-ll-inches
tall, weighs 150 pounds, and has
brown hair and blue eyes.

The Schoenfelds are the sons of Dr.
John Schoenfeld, a podiatrist with of-
fices in Menlo Park in San Mateo
County.

1976-57,Oct-08-1976,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
President Ford and Jimmy Carter
have set off shock waves am
politicians and diplomats with their
second campaign debate. Among
voters, the audience that really
counts, an Associated Press poll today
gave Carter a narrow edge.

Ford’s pronouncements on Eastern
Europe and the Arab boycott, and a
hard line by Democrat Carter on the
Panama Canal Zone, stirred instant
controversy. At the same time, the
debate thrust foreign and defense
policy to the forefront in the


presidential campaign.

The 90-minute debate was livelier
than the first encounter between the
Republican President and his
challenger. Both were more
aggressive this time. Each attacked
his opponent more freely, dropping
much of the restraint and studied
politeness that had marked their first
confrontation.

The AP telephone survey of 1,071
registered voters was conducted
immediately after the debate Wed-
nesday night. It showed 38.2 per cent
thought Carter had won, 34.6 per cent


rated Ford the victor, and the rest
called it a tie or said they didn’t know
who won.

The theoretical margin of error for
a sample of this size is about 2.9 per
cent in either direction if the results
are projected to reflect the reaction of
the entire debate audience.

So neither man was a clearcut
winner. By similar margins, Ford
gained the advantage in an identical
survey after the first debate, two
weeks ago.

The poll also showed that Carter
had slightly increased his lead over
Ford in the presidential preferences
of those who watched the televised
debate. Before the debate, Carter led
Ford 45.8 per cent to 43 per cent.
Afterward, Carter’s margin had in-
creased, and stood at 48.5 to 44.8.


The AP poll was conducted by
Chilton Research Services of Radnor,
Pa.

Highlighted by sharp differences on
details but broad agreement on the
objectives of foreign and defense
policy, the debate no sooner had ended
than both candidates said they
thought they had done well.

“| think I won and I’m sure he feels
the same way,” Carter said as he left
the ornate Palace of Fine Arts, site of
the nationally televised debate.
Carter said he had rated the first
debate a tie “‘but I feel better about
this one.”’

“I think we did all right,” said Ford.

Both men had the same reaction
after their first encounter two weeks
ago in Philadelphia.

The third and final debate between


the two presidential candidates is
scheduled for Oct. 22, in Williamsurg,
Va. On Oct. 15, their vice presidential
running mates, Sens. Walter F.
Mondale, D-Minn., and Bob Dole, R-
Kans., will debate, most likely ir


Houston.

The Associated Press poll that
followed the first debate concluded
that Ford picked up some support.
The first debate covered domestic and
economic policy.

Employment rose by 74,000 in August to 88
million out of a work force of 95.5 million,
after a gain of 400,000 in July.

There were some bright spots in the job
picture, including a 240,000 increase in
non-farm re ne and improvement
in the unemployment rate for adult men,
usually the family bread-winner.

And the unemployment rate climbed at a
slower pace than in June and July. After
gradually falling since the spring of 1975,
joblessness jumped a half a percentage
point in June and July, followed by the one-
tenth of a per cent hike in August.

In August, the number of people without
work increased by about 80,000 to 7.5

million, the largest since 7.8 million
couldn't find work last December.

The increase in joblessness has thrust
unemployment onto center stage as a key
issue in this fall's presidential election
campaign.

The increases have raised new fears
among economists over the path of the
ecnomic recovery, and could create
serious political problems for President
Ford, who in campaigning for election, has
adopted moderate economic policies to
avoid a resurgence in inflation.

The Democrats and their presidential
nominee, Jimmy Carter, have made jobs
their No. 1 issue and are calling for new
measures to reduce unemployment.

In addition, AFL-CIO President George
Meany is blasting the Ford administration
on the issue. In his Labor Day message,
Meany said that “true unemployment —
counting those perons who have given up
looking for work or have accepted part-
time work — is 10.3 per cent.

Since reaching its recession low in
March, 1975, employment has grown by 3.9
million, or an average monthly increase
over the 17-month span of nearly 230,000.

The unemployment rate is based on a
nationwide survey of some 47,000
households. A more accurate but less
extensive survey is made of the business
establishments, which showed in August
that non-farm payrolls were up by 240,000
to 79.4 million.

The government said employment in-
creases occurred in about 60 per cent of 172
private non-farm industries surveyed.
Manufacturing payrolls were up by 85,000
in August, in part due to settlement of
several strikes.

Most of the increase in unemployment
last month was among young females,
aged 17 to 24. The teenage jobless rate,
which had been declining gradually since
the beginning of the year, jumped from
18.1 to 19.7 per cent.

Jobless rates for adult men declined
from 6.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. The rate
of adult women was virtually unchanged
at 7.7 per cent, while the rate for household
heads dropped from 5.4 to 5.2 per cent.

Jobless rates for white and black
workers, at 7.1 and 13.6 per cent,
respectively, were about the same in July.
However, the rate for black teenagers,
which had dropped substantially in July,
jumped in August from 34.1 to 40.2 per
cent.

1976-60,Dec-13-1976,"ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) — W. Michael
Blumenthal, a specialist in international
economics who served in the Johnson and
Kennedy administrations, is President-
elect Carter’s choice to be treasury
secretary, sources close to Carter say.

Carter also was said to be “almost
certain’ to name Jane Cahill Pfeiffer, a
former vice president of IBM Corp., as
commerce secretary.

The President-elect is holding further
meetings at the governor’s mansion here
today with other Cabinet prospects. He
said he will announce some Cabinet-level
appointments at a news conference at 1:30
p.m. CST Tuesday.

Another Cabinet post which Carter is
believed ready to fill is that of defense
secretary. Harold Brown, a Pentagon
official in the Johnson administration, has
been rumored as the top contender for that

post.


Carter’s meetings today involved
potential candidates for attorney general
and secretaries of agriculture and housing
and urban development.

First to arrive for an interview was Rep.
Bob Bergland, D-Minn., a farmer and
member of the House Agriculture Com-
mittee who is being considered for
secretary of agriculture.

Also on the calling list were two men
considered for the top post at the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development:
Robert C. Embry Jr., commissioner of
Baltimore’s housing and community
development, and Franklin Thomas, a
black who heads the Bedford-Stuyvesant
Corp. in Brooklyn.

U.S. Dist. Judge Frank Johnson and
retired Circuit Court Judge Griffin Bell,
both Southerners, also were meeting with
Carter. Their advice was sought for choice
of attorney general, and one of them could
wind up being considered for the post.
Accompanying Bell was Sen. James 0.
Eastland, D-Miss., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee which will review
Carter’s nomination for attorney general.

Carter’s final appointment of the day
was with Ray Marshall, a University of
Texas economics professor who
presumably could be a candidate for an
economics-related post.

Carter press secretary Jody Powell said
the President-elect’s news conference
Tuesday will be held either at the gover-
nor’s mansion or the auditorium of a near-
by museum. The session will be available
for live television and radio broadcast, he
said.

Carter previously announced he was
naming Cyrus Vance, a Wall Street
lawyer, to be secretary of state, and


Thomas B. Lance, an Atlanta banker, to be
his budget director.

Blumenthal, 50, is chairman of Bendix
Corp., the diversified manufacturer based
near Detroit. He was born in Germany and
came to the United States in 1947,
becoming a U.S. citizen five years later.

He was deputy assistant secretary of
state for economic affairs in the Kennedy
administration.

1976-61,Dec-07-1976,"ATLANTA (UPI) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter today interviewed four
more prospective cabinet appointees,
including a woman and a nuclear
physicist, before flying to Washington for
two days of transition meetings.

Carter summoned California physicist
Harold Brown, Jane Cahill Pfeifer,


Democratic Congressman Brock Adams
of Washington State and Bendix Corp.
President Michael Blumenthal to the
Georgia governor's mansion, which is on
loan to the former governor.

Vice President-elect Walter Mondale
sat in on the second day of intensive
interviews by Carter, who met with


several prominent names from past
presidential administrations Tuesday.
Speeding up his transition to the White
House, Carter also arranged to fly to
Washington late in the afternoon and
gather with representatives .of the
National Governors Conference before a
round of meetings with federal agency


leaders on Thursday.

Brown, president of the California
Institute of Technology, apparently was
being given strong consideration by the
President-elect for the post of defense
secretary.

Deputy Press secretary Rex Granum
told reporters Carter would also meet
with Mrs. Pfeifer, a former vice
president of IBM Corp. and understood to
be under consideration to be commerce
secretary. She lives in Washington

Adams, chairman of the House Budget
Committee, was reportedly being
interviewed for the job of transportation
secretary. Blumenthal was a trade
negotiator in the Kennedy administration
and his name has been mentioned among
possible candidates for treasury
secretary.

Carter's first caller today was Rep.
Andrew Young. DGa., who told reporters
he made the visit as ‘‘a friend’’ and not as
a potential candidate for a top position.

It was understood that Carter will meet
in Washington with Rep. Barbara
Jordan, D-Tex., as he pursues his search
for an attorney general.

President-elect Carter met for
more than an hour Friday af-
ternoon with Idaho Governor
Cecil Andrus, and there was
every indication he would an-
nouce his selection of Andrus as
the secretary of interior at a
news conference Saturday.

Andrus, who had planned to
leave the Plains area after the
interview decided instead to
remain at an _ undisclosed
location in the Plains area. The
Carter office in nearby
Americus announced that the
Presidentelect would hold a
news conference at 9 a.m. CST
Saturday.”

No names other than Andrus’


have been mentioned recently
for the interior secretary
position, and most speculation
has been that it would go to a
western governor.

Carter has brought all of his
Cabinet-level nominees to the
news conferences announcing
his choices. Aide Gregory S.
Schneiders, asked whether
reporters would see Andrus on
Saturday morning, replied: “!
imagine you will see him in the
morning.”’

Andrus, who first met Carter
when both were freshmen
governors in 1970, flew into the
grass landing strip that is the
Plains airport Friday afternoon
and said it was “pretty ob-
vious” that be was interested in
the Interior job.

Andrus is current chairman
of the National Governors
Conference. His term as
governor expires in 1978.

A news conference at first
was announced for Sunday, but


after Saturday's session was
announced, it appeared that no
meetig with the press would be
held Sunday.

Earlier Friday, Carter and
Cyrus Vance thanked Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates for breaking with
other oil nations to hold price
increases at 5 per cent. The
President-elect’s spokesman
called the outcome fair and in
the common interest.

Vance, designated by Carter
to be secretary of state, said in
New York he is ‘greatly
pleased.’’ Bert Lance,

Reagan and his managers
had tried hard to convince po-
litical opinion makers that run-
ning reasonably close to Ford
was all that should be expected
of them. But offstage, Reagan
men clearly thought they had
the lead and might win out-
right.

“I feel what's happened
tonight is a victory,’’ Reagan
said after midnight, with the
Republican verdict still in
doubt.

‘“‘Hogwash,”’ countered Rep.
James Cleveland, the Ford
campaign chairman. ‘A
victory is a_ victory,
particularly for an incumbent


who is making tough decisions
... against a guy who can come
out of the west and make
promises every day of the
week.”’

There was another phase in
the primary, and Ford was
winning that decisively. With
the vote count nearing com-
pletion, delegates backing him
for the nomination led for 19 of
the 21 seats New Hampshire
will have at the Republican
National Convention.

Carter led for 13 of the 17
Democratic delegates, Udall
for four.

Howard H. Callaway, Ford’s
national campaign manager,
said Reagan had been beaten
in his strongest northern state.


Reagan said he had done better
than anyone should have ex-
pected.

They can argue about that
forever — or at least until the
next primary. The fact is that
Ford won, in a state where
Reagan enjoyed the ardent
support of the dominant news-
paper, the Manchester Union-
Leader, the backing of Gov.
Meldrim Thomson and a supe-
rior campaign organization.

Reagan was campaigning to-
day in Illinois, which holds its
primary March 16, but by
nighttime, he is due in Tampa,
Fla. And the New Hampshire
loss may well lead him to in-
tensify his personal campaign
in Florida.


“They told us that any kind
of a victory would help the
President in Florida,’’ a Ford
campaign strategist said.
“Well, we've given them any
kind of a victory.”’

The Reagan ploy had been to
try to hold Ford to the standard
expected of elected presidents.
That’s what did in Lyndon B.
Johnson eight years ago, when
he won the New Hampshire
primary but was rated a loser
because he only had a seven
point margin.

But Ford is not an elected
President. He holds office by
appointment and succession.

was his first electoral test out-

1976-64,Nov-30-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President-
elect Jimmy Carter says he has ‘‘sent
word” to the nation's steel producers,
urging them to reverse recent price
hikes to avoid giving the oil-exporting
countries an excuse to raise petroleum
prices,

But Carter says the steelmakers were
noncommittal in their responses.

Carter said Monday that senators and
House members were conveying his
message to the companies that higher
steel prices will have a severe impact on
inflation around the world.

In an interview with CBS anchorman
Walter Cronkite, Carter said that if steel
“prices are going up, | think it would be
a good excuse for Iran and other nations
to say, ‘Well, if you increase steel prices
in the middle of our oil meetings, then
it’s legitimate for us to raise our oil
prices.’ ""’

Iran and other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the oil cartel, are meeting in
December to discuss an increase in oil
prices, OPEC has defended previous
price hikes by pointing to higher costs of
manufacture goods made in oil-
importing countries.

In the wake of the decision Monday by
U.S. Steel, the nation's largest steel


producer, Bethlehem Steel and Republic
Steel to make the price hike virtually
industry-wide, U.S. economists were
— the higher cost of steel is
ikely to push up prices for a wide varie-
ty of consumer goods in the months
ahead,

Carter said during his campaign that
he would ask for stand-by authority to
impose wage and price controls, al-
though he said he didn’t think they would
be used. However, some economists
have said that even the possibility of
prce controls may be causing worried

usinessmen to push through price
increases they might otherwise wait on.

Meanwhile, Jerry Jasinowski, head of
the economic prey group in Carter's
transition staff, declined to speculate
whether the steel companies are seeking
to take advantage of the transition
period. between the outgoing Ford
administration and the incoming Carter
administration in pushing through their
price hikes.

The increases, which are generally €
per cent on flat-rolled steel, the kind
used in autos and appliances, are
effective Wednesday.

The Ford administration's Council on
Wage and Price Stability also is looking


into the increases and is preparing a re-
port for President Ford.

The administration lacks authority to
roll back price increases, and the
investigation is intended simply to force


the companies to justify their action.
The steel producers that have
announced price hikes will be asked to
submit information to the council on

1976-65,Apr-21-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Daylight Saving
Time begins Sunday. Remember, it’s
spring ahead, fall back.

If you like to stroll, swat a tennis ball or
water the garden in the evening, then
come Sunday you'll have an extra hour of
light to indulge in all your favorite

stimes. But if you're a farmer or like to
jog before breakfast—well, sorry.


Either way, clocks move forward
Sunday one hour for the six months of
Daylight Saving Time (DST) from 2 a.m.
Sunday to 2 a.m. Oct. 31. And, if you get
confused on which direction to move the
hands, just remember the saying, ‘‘Spring
ahead, fall back.”’

The extra daylight hour may come in
handy for Congress as it grapples with
proposals to change the system of six
months of DST and six months of standard
time.

Earlier this year, the Senate passed a
bill to provide seven months of DST this
year and next, from mid-March until mid-
October. But inaction by the House
Commerce Committee kept it from taking
effect in time for the spring.

more important.

Until some sort of bill clears both houses
of Congress, the nation remains on the
pattern of six months of DST and six
months of standard time each year.

The move to extend DST was begun in
late 1973 during the peak of the energy
crisis. Some advocates contended that
longer evening daylight hours, when most
persons are awake, can result in an energy
savings.

But those opposing DST argue that less
daylight in morning endangers school
children and inconveniences farmers.
They also said DST saved little, if any,
energy

A fourth guerrilla and
four hostages were killed


and 34 hostages were

Before they were

1976-67,Feb-28-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Postal
Service says it is considering cutting
mail delivery to three days a week.

J. T. Ellington, a senior assistant
postmaster general, said in an inter-
view Thursday that three-day-per-
week delivery is “one of the options”
the financially troubled agency is con-
sidering in its campaign to cut costs.


Although more drastic cutbacks have
been discussed, Ellington said, “OUR
MOST IMMEdiate option is reduction
by one day in delivery service.” Postal
officials had said previously they are
considering eliminating delivery on
Saturday or one other day of the week.

Postal service officials have said the
savings from elimination of delivery on


Saturday would be about $350 million
per year and savings would be
somewhat higher if delivery is dropped
on a business day.

Ellington said the possibility of
three-day-per-week delivery was dis-
cussed at a recent meeting of the agen-
cy’s board of governors.

“We'll have to see how things go in


the financial area and then decide what
we have to do,” he said.

Other service cutbacks under con-
sideration include ending special
delivery, postal officials say.

“We are not excluding anything from
consideration,” Ellington said.

The Postal Service would have to
seek the approval of the Postal Rate


Commission, an independent agency,
before eliminating any service.

The postal deficit is estimated to
reach a record $1.5 billion for the fiscal
year ending June 30.

One problem the Postal Service faces
is that “everywhere we turn on cutting
costs, somebody opposes it,” Ellington
said.


In one such action Thursday, a
federal judge blocked the Postal Ser-
vice from closing rural post offices to
save money.

U.S. District Judge John Lewis
Smith issued a temporary ye apse
order against the economy plan
scheduled a hearing for March 3 on
whether to make his order permanent.

1976-68,Aug-11-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Roll up your
sleeves, the flu shots are coming.

Congress passed a swine flu insurance
program Tuesday, ending a stalemate
that had threatened to leave the vaccine
sitting on manufacturers’ shelves.
Health officials now say swine flu
inoculations will be available starting
next month.

Brushing aside usual procedural
niceties, the House and Senate both
voted Tuesday to get the program
moving in the wake of some concern
over a mysterious disease that has killed
27 persons in Pennsylvania. That disease
has not been linked to flu.

Saying an outbreak of swine flu ‘‘could
mean the death of millions of people,”’
President Ford had urged passage of the
insurance bill in telephone calls made
Tuesday morning to congressional
leaders.

Ford is certain to sign the measure.

The first shots next month will go to
the elderly and chronically ill. The rest
of the nation is expected to start getting
the free shots by about mid-October,
officials said.

Four drug firms already have
rocessed 120 million doses of vaccine
ut refused to sell any to the government
until securing protection against
lawsuits by users who might suffer ad-
verse effects.

Government intervention in the
liability protection facet of the program
became necesssary after private
insurers refused to provide coverage to
vaccine producers. Insurers claimed
billions of dollars worth of claims might
be filed if problems arose from what
would be the biggest mass inoculation
program in U.S. history.

Under the legislation, passed on
unanimous voice vote by the Senate, and
on a 250 to 83 vote by the House, the
government would pay the legal defense
bill against any lawsuits brought by
vaccine users,

If a complainant proved negligence
against a drug firm or volunteer medical
personnel administering the shot the
government could sue to collect from the
private insurer for the drug firm or
practitioner.

But the government is going to wind up
paying the manufacturers’ insurance
premiums for even this limited
coverage. After drug and firms
negotiate a price, that amount will be
added to the price drug firms are
charging the government for the
vaccine.

But the legislation prohibits


manufacturers from making any
outright profits on the swine flu vaccine.

To try to hold down potential lawsuits,
the bill requires court action to begin
within two years of any alleged injury or
damages.

1976-69,Aug-17-1976,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — With
party rules and platform planks as the
issues, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald
Reagan are heading into the first
critical test of their delegate strength at
the 1976 Republican National Con-
vention

Reagan and his strategists chose the
issues on which the key votes would be
taken tonight, but as the time for
balloting drew near Ford's delegate
total in the contest for the presidential
nomination moved to within three votes
of the 1,130 needed for victory

THE LATEST Associated Press
survey, based on legal commitments
and publicly stated preferences, gave
Ford 1,127, Reagan 1.036, with 96 un-
committed

For weeks the Ford camp has
claimed the President had 1,135 votes,
while Reagan's managers have said the
former California governor was certain
of 1,140 votes on the first ballot for the
presidential nomination.

But those claims were viewed largely
as part of the intense political,
psychological warfare the two men
aimed at each other and at the un-
committed delegates who hold the key
to the aspirations of both men.

The roll call votes tonight, occurring
just 24 hours before the presidential
balloting, will be taken as a clear sign
of which man will leave Kansas City as
the Republican nominee for president.


A decisive victory for either man
could cripple the other's chance for the
nomination

THE REAGAN forces are geared for
a floor fight tonight on their proposal to
require that each presidential can-
didate name his proposed running mate
before the balloting on the presidential
nomination

Reagan backers call it the ‘right to
know’ rule. The Ford camp describes it
as Reagan's attempt to force the
President to endure an uproar similar
to that which Reagan encountered
when he named Sen. Richard S. Sch-
weiker as his choice for the vice
presidential nomination. *~ ~*~

Ford's backers called the Reagan
proposal the ‘‘misery loves company”
rule.

The other major fight planned by the
Reagan camp involves the foreign
policy plank in the Republican platform
which will be presented to the con-
vention for approval

ENTITLED “Morality in Foreign
Policy.’ the Reagan amendment to the
platform would insert a statement
implicitly critical of the policy of
detente with the Soviet Union pursued
by Ford and Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger.

The Reagan statement would put the
Republican party on record as sup-
porting many of the criticisms of Ford
foreign policy that the former
California governor used as campaign

1echmac


Nonetheless, some Ford advisers
were recommending that the President
accept the amendment and avoid a
divisive floor fight. according to
sources close to the campaign.

But Sen. Robert P. Griffin of
Michigan, Ford’s convention floor
manager, said a final decision on how to
deal with the proposal probably


wouldn't be made until Ford strategists
could assess the vote on the rules,
scheduled to come up before the
platform committee report.

ANOTHER platform fight is likely to
eceur on the abortion issue. But that
does not involve a test between Ford
and Reagan supporters.

1976-70,Aug-12-1976,"WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — An 11-minute hail
of sniper bullets from the top floor of a
Holliday Inn raked shoppers and workers in
Wichita’s downtown area, killing two per-
sons and wounding seven.

The gunfire on Wednesday from the top of
the tallest building in Kansas ended when
five police officers fired a volley of shots
through a wall, wounding a 19-year-old man
armed with two rifles.

The man, identified as Michael Soles of
Sand Springs, Okla., was under guard at a
hospital. He was reported in fair condition
with leg wounds. Charges were expected to
be filed today.

Victims of what witnesses said was ap-
parently random firing from the 26th floor of
the Holiday Inn Plaza included workmen
and office workers, shoppers, teen-agers
waiting to buy tickets to a rock concert and a
news photographer who had rushed to the
scene.

Dead were Joe Goulart, 56, a free-lance
photographer killed when a bullet smashed
through the windshield of his car less than a
block from the hotel; and Elmer W. Hen-
sley, 57, a glass company worker, who died
after he was struck in the back by a bullet as
he stood on the roof of an adjoining building.

One of the seven persons wounded was in
critical condition and two were listed as in
serious condition.

Soles was described by relatives in
Oklahoma as a ‘deeply religious boy’’ wha
had no history of trouble. A welder by trade,
he had gone to Wichita several months aga
seeking work, they said.

Friends and neighbors in Wichita
described Soles as friendly and personable,
a chunky, red-haired young man who helped
one man fix his car and was a babysitter for
the children of the minister with whom he
was staying. The minister, the Rev.
Timothy Hutton, would not talk with
reporters.

Scores of police converged on the Holiday
Inn within minutes of the first shooting
report at 2:54 p.m. Wednesday. Shots were
already raining down on the street as police


opened fire. Bullets spattered buildings and
streets during a light drizzle.

‘‘I must have heard 30 or 35 shots,’’ said
Dan Bachmann, an attorney in a neigh-
boring building. ‘‘Then I saw him (the gun-
man) throw down what appeared to be two
rifles. The next thing I saw up there were
two or three police officers.’

Among the seven wounded was Mark
Falen, 23, a bank loan officer, who was in
critical condition with a neck wound he
received while walking to his office.

In serious condition were Arnold Merritt,
51, another glass worker who was hit in the

1976-71,Feb-27-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The
government said today that its
index of lea economic
indicators marked its biggest
increase in six months during
January, signaling a more
robust economic growth ahead.

The Commerce Department
said its composite index
comprised of a dozen individual
economic statistics selected for
their i sie to foresee
economic developments rose by
2.2 per cent in January.

That was the biggest increase
since a 2.5 per cent jump in July
and ended five months of virtual
stagnation in the index. The
January increase alone sur-
— the total 2.1 per cent rise

or those five months.

At the same time, Commerce
revised to nine-tenths of a per
cent the index increase for
December. The _ increase
originally had been reported as
fourtenths of a per cent.

In the past, the index has
anticipated economic tur-
narounds by three months or so,
and the latest report signaled a
stronger economic growth,
particularly in the business
investment sector, in the
months ahead.

Factors contributing most to
the January rise were the
volume of contracts and orders
for new factories and facilities
and stock prices.

' The monthly average of 50
stocks used in the government


index showed a 9.2 per cent
increase in January. The
volume of new plant and
equipment either contracted for
or ordered during the month
jumped ahead by 13 per cent.

The signals from Commerce’s
composite index were in line
with other economic indicators
showing that stronger growth in
the economy is likely in the next
few months. After an initial
strong spurt in economic
growth at the onset of the
recovery last spring, growth
slowed signifcantly over the fall
and early winter.

But now consumer spending
is continuing to be strong, and
there are early signs that
business is now prepared to
begin spending more on in-
creasing its capacity.

Only 11 of the 12 individual
indicators in the composite
index were available for the
January report, but only two of
them — holdings of cash and
near-cash by business and
consumers and the money
supply — showed declines.

Signaling economic growth
along with higher stock prices
and bigger orders for business
spending were an increase in
the average work week, a
reduction in the layoff rate for
manufacturing, higher prices to
producers of key wholesale
goods, formation of more new
businesses, increased orders for
producers of consumer goods.

1976-72,Sep-28-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The
government index designed to
anticipate future economic
trends fell during August for the
first time since the current
recovery began, the gover-
nment reported today.

The Commerce Department
said. its. composite index _ of
leading indicators fell 1.5 per
cent in August, due primarily to
a higher layoff rate in
manufacturi and reduced
business spending.

The drop is the first since
February, 1975, and the largest
since the 3.4 per cent decline a
month before that.

A decline in the index is
generally a signal of slower
growth in the economy. The
initial report is subject to
substantial revision, so that the
initial figures are _ not
necessarily solid. Most
economists consider a three-
month drop or increase in the
index to be necessary before
they consider a change in
direction for the economy is
indicated.

But the index drop does come
after three consecutive months
of a rising unemployment rate
despite growing employment

in the midst of what
administration economists
consider a lull in economic
growth.

Administration economists
have been contending that the
lull is only temporary.

The August decline follows a
five-tenths of 1 per cent advance
in July and leaves the index,
which is at 108 per cent of its
1967 average, precisely where it
was in May.

The leading indicator index is
composed of a dozen individual
economic statistics selected for
their position in the forefront of
economic trends. Of the 11
statistics available in time for
computation in the August
index, eight pointed downward,

The layoff rate in
manufacturing jumped to 1.5
per cent in August after
registering a 1.1 per cent rate in
July. The volume of contracts
and orders for factories and
facilities slipped 12.5 per cent
after marking a 1.8 per cent
advance the previous month.

Other factors contributing to
the August decline were a
shorter average work week for
factory workers, a slower
growth in assets held by
consumers and business, a
slower formation of new
businesses, lower stock prices,
a smaller amount of money in
circulation after adjustment for
inflation and a smaller volume
of new orders received by
manufacturers of consumer
products and their suppliers

Upward influences in the
index were higher prices for key
wholesale materials, a larger
number of building permits
issued and slower deliveries by
suppliers. The slower deliveries
is taken as a signal of increased
demand and therefore of
quickened economic activity

1976-73,Mar-29-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government
reported today its index anticipating
economic trends gained for the fourth
Straight month in February, but at a
slower rate than during the previous
month.

The Commerce Department said its
composite of a dozen economic statistics,
called leading indicators, climbed by
eight-tenths of 1 per cent in February.
That compared to a gain of 1.5 per cent in
January, which had been the largest in-
crease in six months.

The January figure was revised
downward from an original estimate of 2.2
per cent.

The index has been gaining steadily,
except for a four-tenths of 1 per cent set-
back in October. It signals steady
economic growth in the months ahead,
although still at a pace slower than before
the nation hit recession in 1973.

Commerce said the biggest factor in the
latest increase was a higher percentage of
companies reporting slower deliveries
from their suppliers. The percentage
reporting slower deliveries climbed from
42 per cent in January to 50 per cent in
February. Slower deliveries are taken as a
sign of increased demand and quicker
economic activity.

In all, eight of the 11 individual sectors
available in time for compilation into the
February composite showed a gain

Among them were a lower layoff rate in


industry, an increase in the wholesale
prices of key commodities, a faster for-
mation of new businesses, higher stock
prices, a bigger money supply after ad-
justment for inflation, a higher volume of
orders for manufactured goods and
greater demand for building permits.

Commerce said the strongest downward
influence on the index was a slower growth
in the liquid assets held by consumers and
non-financial companies. Liquid assets are
those held in cash or investments which
can be quickly converted into cash.

Other downward influences were a
shorter average work week and a lower
volume of orders for factories and
facilities.

1976-74,Jul-29-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government
index on economic trends, released
Wednesday, signaled a continued, though
relatively slow growth in the economy, and
a resulting expansion of job opportunities
for American workers.

The index of leading indicators ad-
vanced in June for the eighth straight
month but by the smallest margin in seven
months.

The Commerce Department said its
index, composed of a dozen individ. al
statistics, rose three-tenths of one per cent
in June. That compared to a seven-tenths
of one per cent rise in May.

The May figure represented a downward
revision for the month from the 1.4 per
cent originally reported. The June ad-
vance was the smallest since the one-
tenths of one per cent registered in
November.

A particularly encouraging note in the
June index was that the primary upward
influence came from a 13.6 per cent jump
in the volume of contracts and orders for
factories and facilities.

The jump reversed a 3.6 per cent decline
in that category in May and indicated that
business may be getting serious about
expanded capacity — and thus creating
jobs — to cope with further increases in
demand.

So far, consumers have been the biggest
spenders in the recovery and bigger
business spending is considered essential
for continued growth.

Also pointing upward in the composite
were faster growth in cash and near-cash
held by consumers and business, higher
prices for key wholesale products, higher
stock prices and slower deliveries by
suppliers,

The slower deliveries are taken as a sign
of increased demand in the economy.

1976-75,Aug-27-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The govern-
ment index designed to show futures
trends in the economy increased 0.5
percent in July, the 17th straight month
it has pointed upward, the commerce
department reported Friday.

The 17-month gain is the longest
since it rose for 20 consecutive months
from December of 1953 through July of
1955.

Known as the composite index of
leading indicators, the index has shown
continuing strength even though other
government indexes — on prices, eco-
nomic growth and employment — have
turned sluggish.

It likely will lend support to Ford ad-
ministration arguments that the econo-
my still is growing, although it may be
growing slower. Some economists out of
government have wondered whether
the economy may be braking to a halt
again.

The commerce department said the
indicators index, which is based on 12
statistical measures of the economy,
rose to 109.5 in July. The 0.5 percent
gain was over a revised June index that
showed a 0.9 percent increase over
May, instead of the 0.3 percent gain re-
ported earlier.

The major strength in the July index,
the agency said, was in the increase in
building permits, which grew sharply
during the month.

Other positive statistics were a re-
duction in the job layoff rate, increases


in contracts and orders for plant and
equipment, rising stock prices, the mon-
ey supply and net business formation.

On the negative side were statistics
for the average work week, delivery
time for ordered goods, changes in liq-
uid assets, changes in sensitive prices
and new orders for manufactured and
consumer goods.

1976-76,Jun-30-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government index which
foreshadows future developments in the economy
climbed by the biggest margin in 10 months during May,
signaling steady expansion of economic activity in the
months ahead.

The Commerce Dept. said Tuesday the composite index
of leading indicators rose 1.4 per cent in May, compared
to a seven-tenths of 1 per cent in April. It was the biggest
increase since July’s 2.8 per cent.

The index is composed of a dozen individual statistics
selected for their ability to move in advance of general
economic trends.

Steady expansion of the economy means more job
opportunities, increased revenues for business and more
money available for paychecks. But the signal from the
leading indicators was somewhat at odds with expecta-
tions for a slower growth rate in the current quarter for
the Gross National Product.

Gross National Product, a broader gauge of economic
health, represents the total output of goods and services
in the economy. It grew at an annual rate of 8.7 per cent
in the first quarter. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
President’s Council of Economic Advisers, warned last
week that the growth rate could slip to 5 per cent or less
in the current three-month period.

The leading indicators offered some support, however,


to Greenspan’s thesis that statistical problems in the
Gross National Product report due out next month will
make economic activity appear lower than it really is.

The latest increase left the composite index 13 per cent
ahead of where it was a year ago. It has increased without
pause since March 1975.

The Commerce Dept. said the biggest upward influence
on the index was the 5.2 per cent increase in the volume
of new orders received by manufacturers of consumer
products and their suppliers.

Other upward influences were a longer average work
week, a faster increase in assets of business and consum-
ers, higher prices for key wholesale materials, faster
formation of new businesses and issuance of a higher
volume of new building permits.

Two factors, the layoff rate and the pace of deliveries
by suppliers, were unchanged.

The biggest downward influence was a 1.9 per cent
drop in contracts and orders for factories and facilities.
Stock prices and the money supply, after adjustment for
inflation, also reflected a downward trend.

Statistics on the 12th component, the change in business
inventories, was not available in time to be included in the
index.

1976-77,Jun-08-1976,"Voters in California, Ohio and
New Jersey cast the final
ballots of the nation’s longest
presidential primary season
today in elections that could tell
whether President Ford can be
overtaken, and whether Jimmy
Carter can be stopped.

It was Ford against Ronald
Reagan and Carter against
three sets of Democratic op-
ponents, for the biggest one-day
delegate crop since the primary
voting began 15 weeks ago.

All told, Democrats were
selecting 540 national con-
vention delegates, Republicans
331.

The early voter turnout in
Ohio was moderate to heavy
with the weather clear.
Crossover balloting was not
expected to be heavy among the
expected 2.55 million voters.

In New Jersey the early
turnout appeared to be light to
moderate, as state officials had
projected.

In California, the polls opened
at 10 a.m. EDT. Voter turnout
was expected to be heavy


because of a  controversia!

and local issues.

Ford entered the last set of
primaries with 804 of the 1,130
delegates needed to win the
Republican nomination
Reagan has 692 and there are
148 in the uncommitted column
Republicans will choose
another 283 delegates in
caucuses and state conventions,
and that is where the com-
petition will focus after today.

Carter is far ahead of the
Democratic field, and bids
today for delegates to move
himself beyond the reach of the
rivals who seek to stop him. He
now has 909, with 1,505 needed
for nomination. That is nearly
three times his closest
challenger, Rep. Morris K

393.5 uncommitted Democratic


delegates, and 141 to be chosen
after the primaries.

Today's balloting lines up this
way:

Reagan, the former governor,
is in his home territory, bidding
for 167 delegates in a winner-
take-all contest with the
President. Ford casts himself
as the underdog but adds: “I
don't rule out the possibility
that there could be a surprise.”’

One Ford aide said a victory
in California would be a
miracle.

hours as Reagan

Rhode Island Democrats
have thrown additional question
marks into the Democratic race
for president by giving Jerry
Brown what he says is a victory
that makes him the preeminent
challenger to front-runner
Jimmy Carter.

On a primary day in which the
voters continued to send out
mixed signals and five of the six
major candidates involved
claimed some sort of victory,
the most noted result was in
Rhode Island.

There a small turnout of
voters gave an uncommitted
slate 32 per cent of the vote to 30
per cent for Carter, the former
Georgia governor, and 28 per
cent for Idaho Sen. Frank
Church.

Brown, the California
governor, had urged voters to
vote uncommitted, and when
they did, he said they were
really voting for him.

In other results from
Tuesday’s primaries, Ronald
Reagan defeated President
Ford in Republican voting in
Montana and South Dakota but
Ford gained a 2-1 victory in
Rhode Island and swept all 19
delegates there. That gave the
President a 28-11 edge in
delegates for the day, although


Montana has still to select its
slate of 20 at a convention.

Carter, meanwhile, was
winning in South Dakota with a
41-34 per cent edge over Arizona
Rep. Morris K. Udall, who had
hoped to win his first primary
and instead finished second for
the eighth time. And Church
captured Montana easily with
over 60 per cent of the vote to 24
per cent for Carter.

So going into next Tuesday’s
primaries in California, New
Jersey and Ohio, which will

1976-79,Aug-24-1976,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP)—A US.
Navy task force headed by the aircraft
carrier Midway approached Korea today.
North Korea said the warships were bound

for its waters and warned that the move
would ‘“‘force a conflict.’’

The five-ship naval force was ordered
from its base in Japan as part of the U.S.
military response to the ax-slaying of two
U.S. Army officers by North Koreans in
the Korean neutral zone last week. The
Navy would not give their exact location or
destination but a Japanese pilot spotted
them shadowed by a Soviet freighter, and
said they could be close to the south coast
of Korea today.

North Korean broadcasts said the naval
operation brought the situation ‘closer to
the brink of war.’’ Rodong Shinmoon, the
Communist party daily warned that North
Korean armed forces are prepared for a
“sacred war ... to annihilate the
aggressors at one stroke if they dare
pounce upon us.”’

Pyongyang radio quoted the newspaper
as ‘“‘denouncing the criminal act of US.
imperialism in sending the nuclear-
powered aircraft carrier Midway into the
waters of the northern half of the
republic...

“By infiltrating their warships into the
waters of another country, the U.S. im-
perialist aggressors force a conflict on the
other side ...""’ it added.

A Navy spokesman denied that the
Midway—built in the 1940's—was nuclear
powered, as described by North Korea.

The 151-mile-long demilitarized zone
separating North and South Korea was
reported quiet, as it has been since the
dispute over the pruning of a tree in the
zone last Wednesday led to a free-for-all in
which North Koreans hacked to death two
Americans.

Thousands of South Korean workers
assembled for rallies today denouncing
North Korea for the attack on a United
Nations Command working party that
was pruning a tree in the joint security
zone at Panmunjom.

The workers shouted ‘“‘Down with
murder-gangster Kim Il-sung,”’ the North


Korean president; ‘‘Clubs for mad dog”’
and similar slogans.

President Chung Hee _ Park's
Democratic-Republican party and op-
position parties issued statements calling
on the government to take ‘strongest
possible measures’’ against Communist
provocations.

The United States and South Korea both
rejected a message from North Korea
which said the clash last Wednesday was
“regretful.”’

“We do not find this message to be ac-
ceptable since it does not acknowledge
responsibility for the deliberate and
premeditated murders of the two U.N.
Command officers,’’ said State Depart-
ment spokesman John Ordway in
Washington.

A Korean official commented: ‘‘The
North Koreans did not express even
condolences over the officers slain, nor did
we find any sense of remorse in their
statement.”’

The South Korean Foreign Ministry said
the message was delivered orally at a
meeting Saturday at Panmunjom. The
English text said:

“It was a good thing that no big incident
occurred at Panmunjom for a long period.
However, it is regretful that an incident
occurred in the joint security area,
Panmunjom, this time.

“An effort must be made so that such
incidents may not recur in the future. For
this purpose both sides should make ef-
forts. We urge your side to prevent the
provocation. Our side will never provoke
first, but take self-defense measures only
when provocation occurs. This is our
consistent stand.""’

The message was delivered five hours
after a U.N. Command force, acting on
orders from President Ford, cut down the
40-foot Normandy poplar which the
working party was pruning when the
North Koreans attacked it. The tree
cutters Saturday were guarded by 30(
American and South Korean combat
troops and an umbrella of Americar
helicopter gunships, jet fighters and BS:
bombers.

The U.N. Command said the tree block:

1976-80,Jul-23-1976,"PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Viking
officials believe they have diagnosed,
and can easily solve, a malfunction on
the Mars lander that caused its soil-
scooping arm to jam.

If their theory of the failure is correct,
Project Manager Jim Martin said
Thursday night, the beginning of the
Mars life search next Wednesday will not
be affected.

Martin said the telescoping arm, which
was designed to reach out for a handful of
Martian soil and dump it in a small
biology laboratory, jammed Thursday
after being extended for a test.

It jammed while being retracted, he
said, apparently because a locking pin
that should have faller free did not do so.

He said that was the ‘“‘most probable
cause” of the trouble. The cure, which
will be tried Sunday, is to command the
robot lander to extend the arm again
until the pin falls to the ground.

If that was indeed the cause, said
Martin, it is likely that there will be no
effect on the mission ‘‘and we will be able
to continue on our present timeline.”

A special team of trouble shooters
came up with the theory after duplicating
the problem on an identical Viking lander
that sits in a sandbox at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.

Martin described the failure as a


“human error.’ He said the lander’s
computer had been fed — long before
Viking 1 arrived on Mars — with an
erroneous command. As a result, the
telescoping arm did not extend far
enough to let the pin fall away.

Martin said there had been no progress
on two other problems plaguing the
lander’s investigation of the red, rocky
surface on which it landed Tuesday.

One was the seismometer, designed to
monitor marsquakes, which never
recovered from the dormant state it
remained in during Viking’s journey
from Earth. But it was too soon to write it
off, officials said.

Communications with the lander over
212 million miles of space were
somewhat limited by a balky transmitter
on the lander. As a result of the un-
diagnosed malfunction, data were being
received for a shorter time each day than
had appeared possible at first.

One result could be, said Martin, ‘‘that
we won't be able to take as many pictures
as we had planned

Engneers were still working on those
problems. They were also continuing to
study the sampler arm failure, because if
the locking pin theory turns out not to be
the cause, there may be some other
cause that would be harder to fix and
could affect the life search.

1976-81,Nov-15-1976,"PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — President-elect
Jimmy Carter says that when his small
Baptist church decided during an
emotional meeting to drop its racial
barriers, “I was just one of the church
members.”

He later welcomed a black man to a
worship service.

Carter, according to his fellow
Baptists, exerted no pressure during
the two and three-quarter hour meeting
Sunday. Nonetheless, the congregation
did as he has advocated since 1965.

It opened the church's doors to all
who want to worship, regardless of race.
And, it voted 107-84 to retain the pastor
who agreed with Carter's pro
integration stand, The Rev. Mr. Bruce
Edwards.

The church decision began a week for
Carter in which he plans to hold a news
conference today at the auditorium of
the Southwest Georgia Agricultural
Experimentation Station near here.
Wednesday, he will meet with Vice
President-elect Walter F. Mondale and
congressional leaders near Atlanta.

The church also voted to set up a
screening committee consisting of the
pastor and four deacons to be elected by
the congregation in about two weeks.

“We felt the whole world was looking
at Plains today,” said one of the church's
deacons, Frank Williams.

The church controversy was started
by the Rev. Mr. Clennon King, a non


denominational minister from Albany,
Ga., onetime Republican gubernatorial
candidate and civil rights activist. Just
before the Nov. 2 election, he tried
unsuccessfully to join the church in a
move many saw as an effort to em
barrass Carter.

Sunday, Carter waited in the rain and
said after the votes were announced,""
think it's wonderful. It vindicates the
church. It vindicates the people of
Plains.”

Carter attended an evening service
Sunday with about 65 other persons,
including the black Secret Service agent
who frequently accompanies him to
church. The whites-only policy, adopted
in 1965, had been ignored for black
reporters, agents, and the tourists who
came to Plains during Carter's can
didacy, until the Rev. Mr. King publicly
challenged it.

Midway through the service, a black
man from Selma, N.C., Roger Sessoms,
entered the church and sat in the pew in
front of Carter.

Then the congregation set up the
committee to screen applicants for
church membership. Finally, it voted

The nation’s unemployment
rate rose from 7.8 per cent to
7.9 per cent in October, the
government reported today,
providing fresh evidence
that the economic slowdown
is continuing.

The unemployment rate is
one of the economic
indicators President-elect
Jimmy Carter is watching
as he considers whether to
propose a tax cut after
taking office in January. He
told a news conference
Thursday night that a tax
cut for average wage
earners “could be a strong
possibility if there is no
change in the rate of growth
of the economy and if
economic indicators should
show a negative aspect.”

The October jobless figure
matched the unemployment
rate in August and
prompted the Labor
Department to describe the
labor market as essentially
unchanged for the past three
months.

But because the labor
force is constantly growing,
the unemployment rate
alone can mask the actual
number of persons affected
by the indicator.

The number of persons

unemployed in October was
7.6 million, the most since


7.7 million were out of work
in December.

Employment, which has
been growing even as the
unemployment rate rose
from 7.3 per cent to 7.9 per
cent this summer, has now
declined for two consecutive
months to 87.8 million. And
that’s the smallest number
of people at work since 87.7


million persons held jobs in
May.

Other recent economic re
ports show an economic
slowdown.

The slowdown has already

been reflected in an
increase in the layoff rate in
manufacturing last month.

1976-84,Dec-21-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The government
had good holiday news for Americans on
Tuesday, reporting a moderate rise in
inflation in November and the biggest
monthly gain in workers’ buying power in
18 months.

It said consumer prices increased three-
tenths of one per cent, the same as in
October. Grocery prices and other food
costs declined for the first time since
March. Interest rates on home mortgages
also fell.

Workers benefitted from an increase of
eight-tenths of one per cent in the pur-
chasing power of their paychecks in
November, although it still only raised
their real earnings to the level of a year
ago, the Labor Department said.

The favorable price report was
especially welcome to the incoming Carter
administration, which is counting on a
moderate inflation rate next year to make
it easier to initiate some of its economic
and social programs.

Prices for the first 11 months of 1976 now
have increased 4.5 per cent. If December
prices maintain the same trend, the in-
crease for the year could be under 5 per
cent, well within the Ford administration’s
goal for the year.

The Labor Department said its Con-
sumer Price Index in November stood at
173.8 of the 1967 average of 100, meaning
that consumers paid about $173.80 on the
average for goods which cost $100 nine

years earlier. | _ ;
The rate of increase in inflation in Oc-

tober and November would result in an


overall rate of slightly more than 3.6 per
cent, if maintained for a full year.

However, most economists believe the
underlying inflation rate in the economy
remains stuck at between 5 and 6 per cent.
Food prices, which are volatile, can cause
this rate to fluctuate up or down from
month-to-month.

The biggest gains for consumers in
November were in food prices, which were
down two-tenths of one per cent. There
were sharply lower prices for fresh
vegetables and pork, and the cost of dairy


products declined for the first time since
early in the year.

Partially offsetting these declines were
a 2.2 per cent hike in beef prices and
another big jump in the cost of coffee,
which has risen about 50 per cent in the
past 12 months. -

Prices of commodities other than food
rose four-tenths of one per cent in
November, the same as in October, with
higher costs of clothing accounting for.
about one-third of the rise. Tobacco prices
also were sharply higher.

vivors to work, promising them extra
food according to the hours they worked
clearing roads or burying the dead.

Spot checks by reporters m several
sections hit by the devastating quake last


Wednesday and more than 525
aftershocks showed aid was getting
through.

In some places it was only a trickle.
But that was welcome for people who had
had nothing but bits of stale bread and
brackish water for five days.

At Pitzicia, survivors lined up
alongside a pickup truck to get tamales
cooked for them by persons living in a
neighboring village.

“We need serum and syringes to
control a serious typhoid outbreak,”’ said
Hector Napoleon Alfaro, director of the
national community development
program. ‘‘We need salt, sugar and lime
for making corn meal.”

Gen. Fernando Romeo Lucas, the
national defense minister, threatened to
withhold food from the little town of San
Martin Jilotepeque because survivors


refused to continue burying the dead
unless they were paid.

Lucas said 2,904 of the town’s 3,760
people were killed when the earthquake
dropped a large area about 24 feet.

“There is immediate danger of an
epidemic unless the bodies are buried or
burned,” he said. But he said orders to
burn the bodies might cause a riot.

Two looters were shot in Guatemala
City, and scattered shots were heard
through the night.

President Kjel Eugenio Laugerud
ordered thieves shot on sight.

Hundreds of thousands still slept under
makeshift tents in streets and parks of
Guatemala City’s heavily damaged El
Gallito district. Many portable latrines
were installed in the district. A double
amount of chlorine was added to the
water supply as service was restored in
most parts of the capital.

About 40 American students studying
Spanish while living with Guatemalan
families in the old capital of Antigua
were stranded by the earthquake. There
were no reports of injuries to the
Americans.

One of them, Cathleen Chandler, 20,
daughter of Los Angeles Times publisher
Otis Chandler, said several children in
the family with which she was living
were injured in the quake as a patio wall
collapsed.

1976-86,Feb-18-1976,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Ford today issued orders barring the CIA
and other intelligence agencies from using electronic or physical surveillance
to collect information on the domestic activities of most American citizens and
organizations.

In a follow-up to his Tuesday night press conference at which he announced
plans for reorganizing the intelligence community, Ford also said he would
support legislation requiring judicial warrants for national security wiretaps
and mail opening.

In a message to Congress, Ford indicated he would seek to expand the power
of the government to open mail, which is now permitted only in criminal in-
vestigations. ‘‘We need authority to open mail ... in order to obtain vitally
needed foreign intelligence information,’’ Ford said.

Ford also proposed a stiff new secrecy law which would provide criminal
penalties for any government employe or contractor who leaks intelligence
secrets. The law also would give the government new legal powers to prevent
the publication of such secrets.

A 36-page executive order that takes effect March 1 also would bar infiltration
of domestic organizations, drug tests on unsuspecting humans and illegally
obtaining federal tax returns.

The restrictions do not apply to the FBI which will be governed by a separate
set of guidelines to be issued within 90 days.

The CIA would be completely barred from electronic eavesdropping inside
the United States, and the National Securtiy Agency would be prohibited from
intercepting any ‘‘communication which is made from, or is intended by the
sender to be received in, the United States.”’

“‘Unconsented physical searches,’ apparently including break-ins, would be
outlawed within the United States or against U.S. citizens abroad except ‘‘under
procedures approved by the attorney general.”’

An accompanying document said that the restrictions placed on intelligence
activities provided for “limited exceptions’’ which, for instance, would allow
physical surveillance of a U.S. citizen who is a present or former employe of an
intelligence agency or one of its contractors, or is “reasonably believed to be
acting on behalf of a foreign power or engaging in international terrorist or
narcotics activities or activities threatening the national security.’’

Parts of Ford’s executive order were not made public ‘because of the sen-
sitivity of the information and its relation to national security,’’ a White House
document said.

There were no specific guidelines disclosed in the executive order regarding
covert operations except a general statement that the CIA should ‘carry out
such other special activities in support of national foreign policy objectives as
may be directed by the President or the National Security Council and which
are within the limits of applicable law.”

As details of Ford’s plan were being disclosed, Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield snapped up Ford's invitation to Congress to tighten its scrutiny over
the intelligence community.

Mansfield said he thought Ford's proposals for revamping the intelligence
structure were ‘‘a good step in the right direction.”’

1976-87,Aug-27-1976,"BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — The U.S. Navy evacuated
some 300 Americans and other foreigners from Beirut
without a hitch today while President Ford and top

Pentagon officials stayed up most of the night in
Washington to monitor the operation.

The 16,900-ton amphibious transport ship Coronado an-
chored off Beirut’s seafront before dawn, and by 10 a.m. (3
a.m. EDT) all of the evacuees were aboard. The Coronado
was to land them in Athens on Thursday.

Among those leaving was U.S. Ambassador Talcott W.
Seelye, whose departure was a closely guarded secret until
the last moment. The embassy said he was going to
Washington for consultations and would return to Beirut.

An embassy official said 160 Americans and about 390
others signed up for the evacuation, but closer to 400 —
“less than half’ of them Americans — showed up this
morning. However, to persons watching the departure it
looked more like 250 to 300 persons, and the White House
said there were about 300.

About 1,000 other American citizens remained in
Lebanon despite warnings fromm the White House and the
embassy that it was the last evacuation the US.
government would organize. Most of those remaining are


of Lebanese birth and have dual Lebanese and American
citizenship.

President Ford kept abreast of the evacuation in a White
House Situation room, flanked by senior advisers. He was
in telephone contact with Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld and his chief military and civilian advisers at
the Pentagon.

Rumsfeld sent Ford’s ‘‘thanks for a good job’’ to the
Coronado. ;

Heavily armed soldiers of Yasir Arafat’s Palestine
Liberation Organization and leftist Moslem Lebanese
police stood guard as the evacuees boarded an unarmed
U.S. landing craft at the former military officers’
swimming club.

The PLO also guarded the previous U.S. evacuation uf
110 Americans and 157 others on June 20. This time, as
then, one Palestinian standing on the seawall above the
loading dock caused a brief stir by firing several shots into
the air. There was no explanation.

A C130 circled overhead to seaward, providing a radio
link between the embassy and Sixth Fleet ships offshore.
The giant aircraft carrier America was reported about 60
miles away in case its fighter planes might be needed.

1976-88,Nov-15-1976,"TOKYO (‘AP)—A_ strong earthquake
struck Peking today, rocking tall buildings
and sending people screaming into the
streets, according to reports from the
Chinese capital. There was no immediate
word of damage or casualties.

The National Earthquake Information
Service in Golden, Colo., said the quake
registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and the
Seismological Institute in Uppsala,
Sweden, rated it at 6.8. That would make it
considerably weaker than the July 28
killer quake in Tangshan, southeast of
Peking, but still capable of causing severe
damage.

The Richter scale is a measure of
ground motion as _ recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one
whole number corresponds to a ten-fold
increase in ground motion, A reading of
six is considered a strong quake, seven
means a major earthquake.

The earthquake that devastated Tang-
shan registered 8.2 on the Richter. Kyodo
said today’s quake was apparently an
aftershock from the July blockbuster.

The official Chinese media made no
mention of the quake. Japan's Kyodo
News Service, in a dispatch from Peking,
said the tremor was felt at 9:54 p.m.—8:54
am. EST, The Japan Meteorological
Agency said the quake was apparently
centered in the northern Hopei province.

The Kyodo correspondent wrote that the
iS-story apartment where his Peking
bureau is housed swayed vigorously. He
said screaming people ran out of apart-
ment houses in Peking's foreigners’
quarters.

After the Tangshan quake the Chinese
refused any foreign aid and never an-
nounced casualty figures or estimates of
damage. But unofficial sources estimated
the death toll in the tens of thousands and
reported extensive devastation in Tang-
shan, an industrial city of 1.6 million. The
quake rocked nearby Tientsin and Peking,
about 100 miles to the northwest.

On Aug. 16, a quake registering 7.9 on
the Richter struck a mountainous region of
central China but reportedly caused only
slight damage.

1976-90,Nov-21-1976,"WASHINGION (UPI) —
Jimmy Carter drew praise
today for his knowledge of
federal finances from President
Ford’s budget director as the
President-elect began a series
of briefings with top adminis-
tration officials.

Carter met with James Lynn
for one hour at Blair House,
across the street from the
White House. He arrived
Sunday night from Plains, Ga.,
for his first meeting with Ford
since their Oct. 22 debate in
Williamsburg, Va. The meeting
was scheduled for 3:30 p.m.
EST.

Carter got an early start on
the first of his two days of
meetings with administration
officials and congressional lead-
ers by eating breakfast with his
wife, Rosalynn, then talking
with his staffers.

Vice President-elect Walter


Mondale arrived shortly before
9 to sit in on the briefings.

Carter first met with Mary
King, one of his key campaign
officials in Washington, who is
involved in presenting names of
potential women candidates for
top positions in the new
administration.

Lynn then arrived to brief


Carter on Ford's forthcoming
budget, which will be presented
Congress in early January.
After the session with Lynn,
Carter discussed Pentagon mat-
ters with Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld. Gen.
Lewis Allen, director of the
National Security Agency, and
Richard Shriver, director of the


Office of Telecommunications,
also sat in on the session.

Carter was meeting with his
official guests in the study on
the second floor of Blair House,
where all important visitors
stay when in Washington.

No specific agenda was
established for the Carter-Ford
meeting, according to a White


House spokesman.

The meeting with Ford was
next on the agenda, followed by
a session with Federal Reserve
Chairman Arthur Burns, who
Carter once hinted he would
ask to resign. Carter later said,
however, it was likely he would
not ask Burns to step down
from the sensitive post.

1976-91,Nov-21-1976,"PLAINS, Ga. (AP) — Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger, accused
by Jimmy Carter during the
presidential campaign of a running
U.S. foreign policy as a ‘Lone
Ranger,” is visiting the president-
elect in his tiny home town to brief
him on international relations.

Carter’s meeting today with
Kissinger was part of a series of
discussions Carter is conductin
with top Ford administration of-
ficials in his preparations for the
presidency.

On Friday Carter spent nearly six
hours in a briefing on national
security matters with George Bush,
director of the CIA.

Vice President-elect Walter F.
Mondale was also in Plains to attend
the meetings with Bush and
Kissinger.

Carter and Kissinger met ‘once
before in 1974 when Carter, then
governor of Georgia, attended a
meeting of the Organization of
American States in Atlanta, said
Carter press secretary Jody Powell.

At that time Carter was impressed
by Kissinger, Powell said.

But during his campaign, Carter
criticized what he called the
‘‘secretive’’ and ‘‘amoral’’ foreign
policies of the Ford administration.
Carter said that instead of letting
foreign affairs be dominated by a


“Lone Ranger’ pursuing a “‘one-
man policy of international ad-
venture,’ he favored ‘‘frequent
consultations on many levels”
among democratic nations.

The President-elect plans to make
his first post-election trip to
Washington Sunday night and confer
with President Ford in the White
House on Monday.

Bush emerged from the lengthy
talks in Carter’s home and said
Carter showed a keen interest’’ on
national security matters.

Powell revealed Friday the
President-elect received a two-page
letter of congratulations last week
from former President Richard M.
Nixon.

Powell announced Friday the
names of 11 persons who will advise
Carter and Mondale on key per-
sonnel matters.

They are: The Rev. Theodore M.
Hesburgh, president, Notre Dame
University; Lucy W. Benson, former
president, League of Women Voters;
Lane Kirkland, secretary-treasurer,
AFL-CIO; Vernon Jordan, executive
director, Urban League; Carol
Foreman, executive director,

Marian Wright Edelman, executive
director, Children’s Defense Fund.

“‘lunchbucket”’ vote, despite the oppo-
sition of several important union
leaders who endorsed Jackson.

Carter has had help from a coalition
of liberal unions and in recent weeks
has stepped up his efforts at wooing
new labor support.

Democratic presidential candidates

_ have traditionally benefitted from the
AFL-CIO’s support in terms of money
and manpower. A rare exception was
in 1972°when the candidate, Sen.
George McGovern, incurred Meany’
wrath and the labor federation sat out

_the election.

Meany, who at one time or another

. has met with all of the Democratic
candidates except Carter, has said
any of them would be acceptable with


the exception of Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace.

Although known to be cool to.
Carter, he told his political strategists
last month to stay out of any stop-
Carter drives.

AN AFL-CIO official said today’s
meeting would give Meany a chance
to study Carter and find out where he
stands on issues concerning labor,
such as jobs and the economy.

“If Meany sees that Carter can
level with him while sitting across the
table, it will help,” the official said.

Some labor leaders are weighing
individual endorsements for Carter
and there has been some talk that the
AFL-CIO ought to abandon its pre-
convention neutrality. But officials of
the giant labor federation insist that
no endorsements would be made until
after the conventions. .

1976-93,Aug-05-1976,"HARRISBURG, Pa. — UPI — State
scientists today tentatively ruled out
influenza as a cause of the mysterious
illness that has killed 23 persons but
said other viruses and poisons remain
possible sources of the hard hitting
disease.

Gov. Milton Shapp said preliminary
reports from the state’s virology
laboratory in Philadelphia indicate the


illness that struck at least 161 persons
who attended an American Legion
convention in Philadelphia ‘‘most
probably is not an influenza virus.”

“At this time, however, it is still too
early to be entirely conclusive,”” Shapp
said at a news conference. He said the
disease does not appear to be
spreading.

Dr. Leonard Bachman, state health
secretary, said tests were continuing
but he said the latest data seemed to
leave some other viruses or toxic


chemicals as the most likely cause of
the mysterious ailment.

Supporting the possibility that some
other type of virus might be involved
were tests with specimens from three
patients. Dr. Jay E. Satz, director of
the virology division at the
Philadelphia Bureau of Laboratories,
said early results from those studies
suggest a virus may be involved.

Officials at the National Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta also said
fungus-type diseases, primarily


histoplasmosis, remained a
possibility.

The latest victim added to the
state’s confirmed list of Legion illness-
related deaths was Mrs. Arlene E.
Muffley, 55, of Lycoming County. She
died of pneumonia and underlying
coronary disease and had attended the
Legion convention two weeks ago that
is the common link in all the cases.

“Even though we do not have any
final answers, I’m somewhat relieved
by information we do have available


this morning for it does not appear that
this is an outbreak of swine flu,’’ Shapp
said.

“Our laboratory is of course con-
tinuing its exhaustive tests to discover
the nature of the disease and we're
hopeful that the results of these tests
and other being conducted at the
Center for Disease Control in Atlanta
will give us a more definitive answer in
the near future.”

It appeared the first viral test data
from the CDC would be available


rriday.

But Dr. David Sencer, director of the
CDC, said it may take scientists a
week or more to find the agent
responsible. And even then they might
come up empty-handed.

The symptoms were those of severe
influenza, but doctors said flu viruses
are highly contagious and as of
Wednesday there had been no evidence
the ailment had spread beyond those
linked with the convention.

1976-94,Aug-05-1976,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Health
officials were optimistic today that the
worst may be over in the explosive
outbreak of ‘‘legionnaire’s disease.”
The source remains a mystery, but
there have been no new cases in two
days.

Swine flu and other influenza viruses
have been all but ruled out as medical
researchers continued round-the-clock
efforts to identify the cause of the
illness that has killed 23 persons.

Two persons who exhibited symp-
toms of the disease — fever, chills and
lung congestion — died Thursday in
southwestern Pennsylvania, but state
heath officials have not yet officially
listed them as victims of the disease.
As in all confirmed cases, however,
they had some connection with a state
American Legion convention in Phila-
delphia two weeks ago.

Efforts to identify the source of the
disease now focuses on an unidentified
virus still being sought in the
laboratories and a possible toxin that
may have infected the victims while in
Philadelphia.

New information on a possible viral
source was expected when new tests
are completed today at state Health
Department laboratories in Phila-
delphia and at the U.S. Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta.

Meanwhile, teams of medical
detectives fanned out today to check
the six hotels and scores of restaurants
where those attending the convention
stayed and ate. They were checking
air conditioning systems, water
sources, food and even carpets and
wallpaper, looking for a toxin — a
poisonous substance — that may have
triggered the outbreak.

No new cases of the disease have
been reported since Tuesday, state
Health Secretary Leonard Bachman
reported Thursday. He said that some
of the 138 persons hospitalized in the
outbreak have been allowed to return
home.

There was still no evidence of con-
tagious spread of the disease, he ad-


ded, and evidence points to a
slackening off.

“We believe the reporting system is
good and we are optimistic,’’ said
Bachman, standing before a chart
detailing the preplexing strength with
which the disease broke forth.

The legionnaires opened their
convention in Philadelphia July 21 and
adjourned July 24. The following
Monday, more than a score of people
who attended or had some contact with
the convention were ill.

One man who exhibited the disease
symptoms died Tuesday, July 27,
according to Bachman’s chart. Three
days later, last Friday, four deaths
were recorded. There was one death


last Saturday.

Then came the peak: six deaths last
Sunday and nine, the highest number
for single day, on Monday. More than
100 people were hospitalized by that
time. New cases were being con-
firmed, but all traced back to the
convention. No deaths related to the
disease were reported Tuesday, but
two persons who had been ill for
several days died Wednesday.

“There is a possibility that we will
never find the answer,” said Bach-
man, speaking of the cause for the
outbreak. He promised to continue the
investigation ‘‘for a year or two years
if it is needed to get to the bottom of
it’’

mysterious legionnaires disease
now has killed 27 persons, but a
health official indicates the search
for its cause has slowed since there
is no apparent threat of contagion.

That search takes a new turn
tonight, toward American Legion
members who escaped illness
during the July 21-24 convention.
They will be asked to fill out
questionnaires to help scientists try
to find some common link that did
not exist for the dead and ill.

“We're getting to the stage where
this is going to be a long, drawn-out
investigation and we've got
to...carry out our normal
programs,’ Leonard Bachman,
Pennsylvania health secretary, told
a press conference Sunday.

“As long aS we see no new onsets
and no secondary infections, the
time pressure is not on us as much
as it was in the early days when we
didn’t know the impact on the rest of
the population.”’

If necessary, he said, he will ask
the state legislature when it returns
in September to fund a fulltime
investigative medical team.

The two latest victims were men
in their 60s. Bachman said there still
are critical cases among the other
125 persons stricken by the ailment.

Dennis Boyle, 60, of Hazleton and
Harold Davis, 66, of Philadelphia
died Sunday.

While scientists pursue the
possibility that a toxin or poison
may have caused the deaths, state
health officials are sending


to legion meetings
across the state tonight, delivering
questionnaires to the legion
members who stayed healthy.

The list of 23 questions includes
the following:

—What times of the day during
Friday July 23 were you at the
Bellevue-Stratford and Benjamin
Franklin hotels or on the sidewalk
outside?

—Did you drink coffee or eat
pastry at the Friday morning go-
getter’s breakfast?

—Did you buy anything from a
street vendor?

—Did you use ice? Where did you
get it? Was it cubes or block?

There were also questions about
souvenir packs and what the
legionnaires drank.

Investigators found no common
link to the illness when they asked
similar questions of the sick and
families of the dead.

“We're trying to get a very
detailed profile of all the con-
ventioneers and what they did at the
convention to try to make a physical
comparison of those that became il]
and those who didn’t,’’ Bachman
said.

Although he would not say which
days the investigation would focus
on, Bachman said he felt the search
could be restricted to a single day. .

Nine persons became ill after
attending the convention for one
day, July 23. But some legionnaires
arrived a day before the convention
began, and others met in other cities
before arriving in Philadelphia.

1976-97,Dec-31-1976,"ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) —
President-elect Carter says those who
think ‘‘we have automatic answers or easy
answers to tough questions would be
misleading themselves,’ and several of
his key advisers are beginning to offer
statements that seem geared to lower
Americans expectations

In a television interview taped earlier
for broadcast today, Carter expressed
confidence that “the things that we have
promised during the campaign can be
delivered.”

But his key aides and advisers, gathered


at this island retreat for preinaugural
discussions, were offering statements that
would sound cautious to any who had
anticipated quick changes from the new
administration.

Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell,
told reporters Tuesday that it would be
unrealistic to expect promised defense
budget savings of $5 billion to $7 billion
prior to the 1979 year that begins
Oct. |, 1978.

Defense Secretary-designate Harold
Brown also said he saw no chance of such a
defense reduction “from this year's


budget to next year's budget, for exam-

ple.

Joseph A. Califano Jr., Carter's choice
to be secretary of health, education and
welfare, almost simultaneously was
warning that full implementation of
promised welfare reform may have to
await a healthier economy that would
provide tax dollars to pay for it.

During his long 1976 campaign, Carter
repeatedly spoke of saving $5 billion to $7
billion in defense spending by cutting
waste and inefficiency. But he never said
when such a savings could be realized.

He talked at least once about being
ready to move toward welfare reform soon
after taking office.

But in convening the unusual, if not
unique, preinaugural cabinet meeting here
Tuesday, Carter stressed his deter-
mination to deliver on his campaign
promises and to impress his cabinet
nominees with what he sees as their
responsibility to help him keep his word.

Carter said, “Because my word of honor
is at stake ... if we should default on them it
would be a very serious thing for me
personally, and I think for the respect and
confidence of the American people in their
own government.”

He said he does not anticipate thal
happening, however.

He also said Vice President-elect Walter
F. Mondale will enjoy unprecedentec
authority and will serve as his “chief staf
person.” That means, Carter said, tha
everyone on the White House staff ha
been informed that Mondale as well a
Carter will be their boss.

Mondale participated in the TV ir
terview and said he told Carter that ““w
ought to realize that the history of (the vic
presidency) is nothing short of grim, and

1976-98,Oct-12-1976,"‘TOKYO (AP) -- A Chinese

government spokesman
announced that Premier Hua
Kuofeng has been appointed to
succeed the late Mao Tse-tung
as chairman of the Chinese
Communist party, Japan’s
Kyodo news service reported
today from Peking. The an-
‘nouncement followed reports
that Mao’s widow and three
other Politburo officials were
under arrest. .

Wall posters appeared in
Peking last week reporting the
succession of the 57-year-old
Hua, but there had been no
official announcement. The
spokesman said it had been
delayed to allow the entire
Communist party organization
to be informed in advance,
Kyodo said.

There still was no confir-
mation of unofficial reports
from Peking that Mao's widow,
Chiang Ching, and three other
high ranking officials
associated with the party's
radical wing had been arrested,
accused of plotting a coup.
These reports suggested that
serious infighting was going on
and that positions still might not
have solidified since Mao died
on Sept. 9.

The official Hsinhua news


agency had not reported Hua’s
appointment. In a communique
on the establishment of
diplomatic relations with Papua
New Guinea, Hua signed as
premier, Hsinhua said.

However, in a story Saturday,
Hsinhua referred to the party
Central Committee ‘headed by
Comrade Hua Kuofeng.”’

Hua, a big, friendly man
relatively unknown to the
outside world, first made his
name in party circles as an
agricultural specialist and local
administrator during the 1950s.
At some point, he came under
the wing of Mao, who named his
public security minister in 1971.

Last April he was named
premier and first party vice
chairman, second only to Mao,
after Teng Hsiao-ping was fired
as vice premier and party vice
chairman. Teng, who had been
expected to succeed his mentor,
Chou En-lai, as premier,
instead became the target of a
massive campaign of criticism,
accused of trying to restore
capitalism in China.

Chou’s death Jan. 8 touched
off a power struggle between
the moderates led by Teng and
party radicals led by Chiang
Ching.

Foreign analysts saw Hua as


a compromise candidate, and it
seems ‘unlikely that his
elevation will settle the in-
traparty differences. Chinese
broadcasts continue to insist on
deepening the criticism cam-
paign against Teng.

A Nationalist Chinese
specialist‘on mainland affairs
said today that the arrest of
Mao's widow, if the reports are
true, could be the result of an
alliance between Hua and
military leaders.

Tsai Wei-ping, director of the
Institute of International
Relations in Taipei, said the
arrest of Chiang Ching and the
three others would protect both
Hua and the military from
radical pressures and attacks.
Tsai’s institute is a private
political research organization.

The Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug reported from Peking
that life continued normally
there, except for the larger than
usual number of soldiers
patrolling central Tien An Men
Square and in front of the most
important offices.

Residents in the Chinese
capital, contacted by telephone
from Hong Kong, said the
reports of the arrests were first
heard in the city Monday
evening and were the topic of
open conversation today.

1976-99,Oct-12-1976,"HONG KONG (AP) — Mao
Tse-tung’s widow, Chiang
Ching, and three other radical
members of the Chinese
Communist party Politburo
have been arrested on charges
of plotting to seize control of the
Chinese government, according
to unconfirmed reports cir-
culating today in Peking.

Residents in the Chinese
capital, contacted by telephone
from Hong Kong, said the
reports were first heard in the
city Monday evening and were
the topic of open conversation
today.

No official confirmation of the
reports could be obtained. The
Japan Broadcasting Corp.
reported from Peking that all
was “quiet and normal” there.
But the open discussion of the
reports emphasized that the
power struggle between
pragmatic moderates and
revolutionary radicals which
began with the death of
Premier Chou En-iai last
January is still raging.

Those reported arrested with
Mao's 62-year-old widow were
Wang Hung-wen, 38, the
Shanghai “boy wonder” whom
Mao elevated from a factory
assembly line to a _ party
vice-chairmanship for his
services to the revolutionary
cause in the 1966-69 Cultural
Revolution; First Vice-Premier
Chang Chun-chiao, 55, a
member of the Politburo’s
standing committee; and Yao
Wen-yuan, 51, a leading
ideologist and polemicist since
the Cultural Revolution purge
10 years ago.

The London Daily
Telegraph's Peking
correspondent, Nigel Wade,
reported that reliable sources
told him the arrests were an-
nounced to political organizers
at special weekend briefings.

The London Financial Times
said the four radicals were
under house arrest, according
to ‘unconfirmed reports from
Peking.” It said the reports
suggested that “the power
struggle which surfaced within
the leadership before Chairman
Mao died has since intensified.”

Wade said few details of the
alleged plot were known. He
said the plotters apparently got


little support from the army,
and he speculated that they
may be charged with such
‘“‘treasonable’’ actions as
forging statements and sayings
attributed to Mao during the
last months before he died on
Sept. 9.

The Telegraph report said the
four radical leaders’ last known
public appearance was on Sept.
30, at a meeting on the eve of
China’s national day.

Japanese correspondents in
Peking reported that none of the


four was at the airport Monday
to welcome Prime Minister
Thomas Somare of Papua New
Guinea when he arrived for a
visit to China. Official airport
welcomes are important oc-
casions in Peking, and political
significance is deduced from
the lineup of officials present.
Somare was greeted by
Premier Hua Kuo-feng and
Vice-Premier Li Hsien-nien, 71,
an expert in financial and
economic affairs. according to
the official Chinese news


agency Hsinhua. There had
been speculation that Chang
would become premier if Hua
succeeded Mao as Communist
party chairman. But the Lon-
don Financial Times reported
that Li fulfilled the duties of
premier at Somare’s arrival.
Japanese reports from
Peking reiterated that Hua had
been chosen for the party
chairmanship. This succession
was announced in wall posters
last weekend, but there has
been no official announcement.
